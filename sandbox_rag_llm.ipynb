A very complete fossil of this sauropod was unearthed in 2009. In life _Dreadnoughtus_ was 26 metres (85 feet) long and weighed about 65 tons.(more)\\nSauropods shared a body plan consisting of: a small head on an extremely long neck; a long, massive body housing an enormous gut; thick pillarlike legs to support the torso; and a very long, tapering, often whiplike tail. A massive hip girdle was fused to the backbone, usually by five sacral vertebrae; this arrangement provided solid support for the body and tail. The backbone itself was hollowed out at the sides, which thus reduced its weight while retaining structural strength. Sauropods were once thought to have spent their time wallowing in shallow water that would help support their ponderous bodies, but considerable evidence indicates that they were better equipped for living on solid ground. The animals’ long necks enabled them to take foliage from even the tallest trees in somewhat the same manner as do modern giraffes. Their teeth tended to be spoon-shaped or pencil-shaped, and they apparently depended on swallowed stones or bacteria in the gut to help break down the plant matter they ate.\\n[](https://cdn.britannica.com/52/8052-050-B535C6B6/Apatosaurus-adult-elephants-rest-body-whiplash-tail.jpg)\\n_Apatosaurus_ _Apatosaurus_ , a late Jurassic dinosaur, was a massive herbivore that weighed as much as five adult elephants. Its long whiplash tail helped to balance the rest of its body when it walked.(more)\\nSauropods and theropods were saurischian dinosaurs. The sauropods evolved into several major subgroups: _Brachiosaurus_), _Camarasaurus_), _Diplodocus_ and _Apatosaurus_), and _Apatosaurus_ routinely reached lengths of 21 metres. _Brachiosaurus_ was one of the largest and most massive of all known dinosaurs, reaching a length of 30 metres and a weight of 80 metric tons. _Dreadnoughtus_ , a titanosaurid, was 26 metres (about 85 feet) long, and its mass was estimated at 59 metric tons (about 65 tons); it was perhaps the largest terrestrial animal that has ever lived.\\nBritannica Quiz Wild Words from the Animal Kingdom Vocabulary Quiz\\nSauropods first evolved in the Early Jurassic Epoch (201 million to 174 million years ago). They became gigantic and highly diverse in the Late Jurassic Epoch (about 164 million to 145 million years ago) and persisted into the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years ago).\\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by John P.

       "  'Sauropod dinosaurs were abundant and diverse across much of the globe throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and include the largest terrestrial animals of all time. Since the discovery of the first near-complete skeletons in the late 19th century, sauropods have been almost universally interpreted as herbivorous. However, our concept of their diet is based on indirect evidence and inference since no sauropod fossilized gut contents (cololites) are known. Here, we describe a cololite associated with a specimen of the sauropod _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ from the mid-Cretaceous (∼101–94 Ma) Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia. The cololite is hosted within an indurated rock layer, localized to the abdominal region, and closely and consistently associated with a layer of mineralized skin. Conifer pinnules, angiosperm leaves, and seed-fern fruiting bodies are preserved within, as are chemical biomarkers consistent with gymnosperms and angiosperms. This _Diamantinasaurus_ cololite provides the first direct, empirical evidence in sauropods of herbivory, demonstrating generalist feeding, low- to high-level browsing, and minimal oral processing of food. The longevity of the clade Sauropoda was underpinned by the persistence through time of generalist feeders like _Diamantinasaurus_ that were capable of feeding at a range of heights on a variety of different plant species.',\n",

       "  'Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaurs were the most diverse and abundant large-bodied herbivores in the southern continents during the final 30 million years of the Mesozoic Era. Several titanosaur species are regarded as the most massive land-living animals yet discovered; nevertheless, nearly all of these giant titanosaurs are known only from very incomplete fossils, hindering a detailed understanding of their anatomy. Here we describe a new and gigantic titanosaur, _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ , from Upper Cretaceous sediments in southern Patagonia, Argentina. Represented by approximately 70% of the postcranial skeleton, plus craniodental remains, _Dreadnoughtus_ is the most complete giant titanosaur yet discovered and provides new insight into the morphology and evolutionary history of these colossal animals. Furthermore, despite its estimated mass of about 59.3 metric tons, the bone histology of the _Dreadnoughtus_ type specimen reveals that this individual was still growing at the time of death.',\n",

       "  \"The sauropod dinosaur clade Titanosauria includes the most massive terrestrial animals yet discovered1,2. Nevertheless, with the exception of _Futalognkosaurus_ —known from much of the vertebral column and pelvis3—all truly gigantic titanosaurs (_sensu_ Sander et al.4; i.e., those with an adult body mass exceeding 40 metric tons) are represented by very fragmentary fossils5,6,7,8,9. The incomplete understanding of the anatomies of colossal titanosaurs has frustrated attempts to characterize important aspects of their evolutionary history and palaeobiology. For example, it is presently uncertain whether extreme gigantism evolved multiple times or only once within Titanosauria4. Furthermore, it is not even clear how large the largest titanosaurs were, with different studies yielding widely divergent estimates of body dimensions7,10,11,12,13.\\nHere we report a new and gigantic titanosaur from Upper Cretaceous (Campanian–Maastrichtian14,15; ~84–66 Ma16) rocks exposed in south-western Patagonia, Argentina (Supplementary Fig. 1), some 1,200 km from the best-known South American dinosaur localities, which occur in northern Patagonia17. Represented by all major skeletal regions (see Supplementary Information), _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ nov. gen. nov. sp. (Figs. 1, 2, Supplementary Figs. 2–18) offers new insight into the skeletal anatomy, bone histology, phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. 19, 20) and body shape and mass of an enormous titanosaur. Most bones are exquisitely preserved, with details such as muscle scars and other osteological correlates of soft-tissues clearly discernible.\\n**Figure 1**\\n[](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06196/figures/1)\\nAxial skeletal anatomy of the gigantic titanosaur _Dreadnoughtus schrani_.\\nPosterior (~9th) cervical vertebra in (A) left lateral, (B) right lateral, (C) posterior and (D) ventral views.

       "  'A gigantic titanosaurian sauropod diagnosed by the following autapomorphies (* = character observable in both known specimens): (1) first caudal centrum with axial ventral keel; (2) anterior caudal neural spines with extensively subdivided pneumatocoel between spinoprezygapophyseal and spinopostzygapophyseal laminae*; (3) anterior caudal neural spines with hypertrophied prespinal and postspinal laminae*; (4) middle caudal neural spines with triangular anterodorsal process that extends well beyond anterior margin of centrum*; (5) anterior haemal arches with paddle-shaped distal expansion*; (6) posterodorsally–anteroventrally oriented ridge on medial surface of anterior end of scapular blade; (7) posteromedial surface of radius concave in proximal view; (8) distal end of radius nearly square, with subequal anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions. (See Supplementary Information for detailed comparisons with _Puertasaurus reuili_ , a fragmentary, similarly-sized titanosaur from the same lithostratigraphic formation).',\n",
       "  'The _Dreadnoughtus_ maxilla houses elongate, peg-like teeth typical of derived titanosaurians (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cervical vertebrae have opisthocoelous centra that lack lateral pneumatic fossae (‘pleurocoels’), though they are internally comprised of highly pneumatized camellate tissue. The centrum of a nearly complete posterior (approximately the ninth) cervical vertebra of the _Dreadnoughtus_ holotype (MPM-PV 1156) (Fig. 1A–D, Supplementary Figs. 3, 10) is 1.13 m in length (Supplementary Table 1). This vertebra exhibits a tall, laterally compressed neural spine that differs dramatically from the transversely expanded spine of the single known posterior cervical vertebra of _Puertasaurus_. (See Supplementary Information for further osteological information.)\\nThe _Dreadnoughtus_ dorsal series is represented by eight partial to nearly complete vertebrae that pertain to the anterior, middle and posterior parts of the sequence (Fig. 1E–J, Supplementary Figs. 5, 11, 12). All dorsal centra are camellate and strongly opisthocoelous with well-developed lateral pneumatic fossae. The anterior (~4th) dorsal vertebra (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Figs. 5A, 11) is nearly complete but strongly dorsoventrally compressed. The neural arch is anteriorly placed and short, thin spinoprezygapophyseal laminae merge with the much more robust prespinal lamina just dorsal to the base of the neural spine. Middle dorsal vertebrae (Fig. 1F–G, Supplementary Fig. 5B–C) closely resemble those of _Rapetosaurus_18 in anterior view, with prominent spinopostzygapophyseal laminae and a correspondingly expanded neural spine apex. Posterior dorsal vertebrae (Fig. 1H–J, Supplementary Figs. 5D–F, 12) have elevated, posterodorsally inclined neural spines, the lateral surfaces of which possess spinodiapophyseal laminae that are divided into paired rami by a deep coel. Along with the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, the posterior rami of the spinodiapophyseal laminae terminate dorsally in rugose projections that are oval in posterolateral view (Fig. 1I, Supplementary Fig. 5E). On the transverse process, immediately dorsomedial to the diapophyseal facet, there is a distinct, slightly raised area ornamented by mediolaterally-oriented striations. A comparable condition is reported in the lithostrotian titanosaurs _Epachthosaurus_ , _Lirainosaurus_ , _Saltasaurus_ , _Trigonosaurus_ and other somphospondylans and has been hypothesized to indicate soft-tissue attachment at this site19,20. Dorsal ribs are plank-like, especially distally and have proximal pneumatocoels (Supplementary Fig. 6A). The six sacral centra are firmly coossified and lack external pneumatic fossae (Fig. 1K, Supplementary Fig. 13). Sacral centra and ribs exhibit camellate internal tissue structure.\\nThe caudal series of _Dreadnoughtus_ is nearly completely preserved, lacking only a few of the posterior-most vertebrae (Fig. 1M, Supplementary Figs. 6B–G, 7, 14). The first 21 caudal vertebrae of MPM-PV 1156 are known from a closely associated sequence; caudal vertebrae 5 to 21 and their associated haemal arches were recovered in articulation (Fig. 1M, Supplementary Figs. 6B–E, 7, 14). The first caudal centrum (Fig. 1L–M, Supplementary Figs. 7, 14) has a well-developed ventral keel, a character that, among titanosaurs, is otherwise known only in a more posteriorly-positioned anterior caudal vertebra of the possible saltasaurine _Bonatitan_21. This _Dreadnoughtus_ vertebra is biconvex, as in derived titanosaurs such as _Alamosaurus_ , _Baurutitan_ and _Pellegrinisaurus_22,23 and has elongate, plate-like transverse processes reminiscent of those of _Saltasaurus_24. The complete left transverse process curves posteriorly before arcing anterolaterally and a prominent roughened tubercle adorns its posterodorsal edge. Digital reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 9) demonstrates that these processes would not have contacted the ilia in life and as such that this biconvex vertebra is not an unfused seventh sacral vertebra as in the saltasaurine _Neuquensaurus_23,25. All remaining caudal vertebrae have strongly procoelous centra that lack pneumatic fossae (Fig. 1M, Supplementary Fig. 6B, D, F, Supplementary Figs. 7, 14). Anterior caudal centra are pierced by small vascular foramina ventral to the transverse processes, as in _Adamantisaurus_26, _Alamosaurus_27, _Andesaurus_28, _Paralititan_7, _Pellegrinisaurus_29 and other sauropods30. Their neural spines are distinctive in possessing hypertrophied prespinal and postspinal laminae (presumably indicative of robust interspinal ligament attachments) and deep, extensively subdivided pneumatocoels between the spinoprezygapophyseal and spinopostzygapophyseal laminae (occupying the position of the conjoined postzygapophyseal spinodiapophyseal and postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae of Wilson et al.31). Comparable but less complex coels occur on the first caudal neural spine in _Alamosaurus_ and _Opisthocoelicaudia_27 and in some anterior caudal spines of _Adamantisaurus_26, _Bonatitan_21, _Dongyangosaurus_32 and _Mendozasaurus_33. Middle caudal vertebrae have elongate prezygapophyses, as in _Aeolosaurus_ spp.8 and closely related taxa and neural spines with triangular anterodorsal processes; the latter are especially pronounced on caudal vertebrae 11 to 13, extending well beyond the anterior margins of the centra (Fig. 1M, Supplementary Figs. 7, 14). Among titanosaurs, the anterior haemal arches of _Dreadnoughtus_ are unique in possessing paddle-shaped anteroposterior expansions of the distal shaft (Fig. 1M, Supplementary Figs. 7, 14).\\nThe appendicular skeleton of _Dreadnoughtus_ is completely represented except for the manus and part of the pes (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 9). The 1.74 m scapula of MPM-PV 1156 (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 15) is the longest yet reported for any titanosaur (Table 1). An oblique, textured ridge, probably indicative of muscle attachment, extends anteroventrally–posterodorsally along the medial face of the blade, posterior to the scar for the M. subscapularis. The coracoid (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 15) is rectangular with a robust infraglenoid lip, as in many macronarians. The sternal plates are mediolaterally wide with rounded anterolateral and posterolateral ends (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Fig. 15). The massive 1.60 m left humerus of MPM-PV 1156 (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 16) is greater in minimum shaft circumference (785 mm) than that of all other described titanosaurs and is longer than all other titanosaur humeri except that of _Paralititan_ (Table 1). Its proximal articulation is convex in anterior view, lacking the proximolateral expansion characteristic of saltasaurids34. The deltopectoral crest is prominent, less medially twisted (after accounting for taphonomic distortion) than in _Mendozasaurus_33 and _Opisthocoelicaudia_35 and extends distally to about one-third the length of the humerus. It remains narrow in width and has a prominent lateral bulge along its distolateral edge, a feature shared with _Alamosaurus_ , _Jainosaurus_ , _Qingxiusaurus_ and _Saltasaurus_36. The ulna (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 16) is stout with a prominent olecranon process and possesses a deep medial depression that renders its proximomedial process concave in proximal view, a condition that is otherwise known only in _Elaltitan_37. The radius (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 16) is gracile with an autapomorphically large concavity on the posteromedial aspect of its proximal end. As in _Rapetosaurus_18, there is a distinct scar on the anteromedial surface of the distal end of the bone.\\n**Table 1 Selected maximum measurements (cm) of appendicular elements of _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ compared to other titanosauriform sauropods, including other gigantic taxa. Non-titanosaurian titanosauriforms (_Brachiosaurus_ , _Giraffatitan_ , _Ligabuesaurus_ , _Ruyangosaurus_) are listed first and arranged alphabetically; remaining taxa are titanosaurs, listed alphabetically. Measurements in bold are the longest known within Titanosauriformes for each element in question. * = estimate; − = element not preserved; NR = measurement not reported. Anatomical abbreviations: C-cl, mid-posterior cervical centrum length; C-cw, mid-posterior cervical centrum width; Fe, femur; Fi, fibula; Hu, humerus; Il, ilium; Ra, radius; Sc, scapula; Ti, tibia; Ul, ulna. Institutional abbreviations see Supplementary Information**\\nFull size table\\nThe preacetabular processes of the _Dreadnoughtus_ ilia (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. 17) are less laterally directed than in many titanosaurs (e.g., _Isisaurus_38, _Saltasaurus_8, _Trigonosaurus_39) and are not strongly canted towards the horizontal. A small, rounded tuberosity, seen elsewhere only in the brachiosaurid _Giraffatitan_40, arises from the ventrolateral edge of the preacetabular process. The robust pubes (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. 17) have proportionately short ischial articulations, as in all titanosaurs more derived than _Andesaurus_22. The distal pubic blade is dorsoventrally thick and tapers medially, similar to the condition in _Opisthocoelicaudia_35 but unlike that of most other titanosaurs. The ischia (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. 17) are short and laminar with a moderately expanded distal blade. As in many sauropods (e.g., rebbachisaurids, most macronarians), a tuberosity for attachment of M. flexor tibialis internus III30 is located near the posterior margin of the lateral ischial face.\\nThe left femur of MPM-PV 1156 (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 18) measures 1.91 m (Table 1). The femoral head is not as proximomedially directed as in many other titanosaurs (e.g., _Jainosaurus_ , _Rinconsaurus_ , _Rocasaurus_). The fourth trochanter is positioned proximal to midshaft and is comparatively better developed than in most lithostrotians (e.g., _Tapuiasaurus_41). Unlike the condition in saltasaurids27, the distal condyles are not bevelled dorsomedially. The tibia (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 18) possesses a large proximolateral bulge similar to that in _Diamantinasaurus_42, _Gobititan_43 and _Uberabatitan_44. The fibula (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 18) is strikingly robust, with a prominent lateral trochanter and a posteriorly curved distal half that renders the bone slightly sigmoid in lateral view. This sigmoid character is shared with _Tastavinsaurus_45 and _Aeolosaurus_ sp.46 and is also reported in one _Neuquensaurus_ fibula25. The astragalus (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 18) is comparable to that of _Camarasaurus_47 and _Elaltitan_37, differing from the tall, pyramidal astragali of many other titanosaurs (e.g., _Diamantinasaurus_ , _Neuquensaurus_). Pedal ungual I (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 18) retains a large flexor process at the proximal end of its plantar surface, a character shared only with _Opisthocoelicaudia_35.',\n",
       "  'Based on a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. 19, 20; see Supplementary Information for details), we posit _Dreadnoughtus_ as a member of Titanosauria, intermediate in phylogenetic position between basal representatives of the clade such as _Andesaurus_ and the comparatively derived titanosaurian subclade Lithostrotia. The enormous forms _Argentinosaurus_ and _Futalognkosaurus_ are also recovered as non-lithostrotian titanosaurs. Future fossil discoveries and phylogenetic analyses of Titanosauria are needed to clarify the relationships of these taxa.\\n_Dreadnoughtus_ is among the largest known titanosaurs. Conclusively establishing the size of the taxon relative to those of most other gigantic representatives of the clade (e.g., ‘ _Antarctosaurus_ ’ _giganteus_ , _Argentinosaurus_ , _Paralititan_ , _Puertasaurus_) is presently not possible due to the fragmentary nature of the latter forms. Nevertheless, elements of MPM-PV 1156 are comparable in linear dimensions to their counterparts in other huge titanosaurs (Table 1). Furthermore, a recently-refined equation for calculating body mass in quadrupedal tetrapods based on humeral and femoral circumference13,48,49 yields an estimate of 59.3 metric tons for this individual (Supplementary Information)—approaching twice the value previously estimated for the large brachiosaurid _Giraffatitan_ (34.0 metric tons) and approximately four times that estimated for the diplodocid _Diplodocus_ (14.8 metric tons)—using the same method13. Reconstruction of the _Dreadnoughtus_ skeleton (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 9) with the mostly missing cervical series restored after that of _Futalognkosaurus_3 produces an approximate body length of 26 m (Supplementary Information).\\nRemarkably, multiple lines of evidence indicate that, despite its enormous size, MPM-PV 1156 was not osteologically mature at death. The scapula remains unfused to the coracoid (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 15) and the posteromedial margin of the coracoid foramen abuts the scapula; both of these morphologies have been cited as indicators of osteological immaturity in sauropods50,51. Moreover, although histological analysis of the humerus indicates that its cortical bone has undergone extensive secondary remodelling, the element retains a thick layer of vascularized fibrolamellar bone between the remodelled inner cortex and the periphery of the periosteal surface (see Supplementary Information). It also lacks lines of arrested growth or an external fundamental system52 (Fig. 2G), which may indicate osteological immaturity53 (although Company54 proposed this as a synapomorphy of Titanosauria rather than an indicator of ontogenetic stage). A similar pattern is observed in the dorsal ribs, which are extensively remodelled but retain primary fibrolamellar bone tissue towards the periosteal surface. Recent analyses55,56 have suggested that titanosaurs may have developed extensively remodelled tissues after reaching sexual maturity but prior to attaining their maximum size. Thus, the presence of unremodelled fibrolamellar bone in the outer cortex of the MPM-PV 1156 humerus suggests that this massive _Dreadnoughtus_ individual was still growing at the time of its death.\\n_Dreadnoughtus_ _schrani_ is the most completely known giant titanosaur. Completeness metrics (Supplementary Table 2) indicate that the new Patagonian taxon has preserved approximately 45.3% of the bones expected in a complete titanosaurian skeleton and (depending on how bones are counted) up to 70.4% of the postcranial elements. By comparison, these same values are 15.2% and 26.8% for _Futalognkosaurus_ , 7.8% and 12.7% for _Paralititan_ , 5.1% and 9.2% for _Argentinosaurus_ , 2.3% and 3.5% for ‘ _A_.’ _giganteus_ and 1.6% and 2.8% for _Puertasaurus_. _Dreadnoughtus_ is also among the most anatomically informative titanosaurs of any body size. The new taxon can be definitively evaluated for 57.5% of the morphological characters included in the data matrix recently published by Carballido and Sander57. Furthermore, _Dreadnoughtus_ is dramatically more informative than the other gigantic titanosaurs included in our phylogenetic analysis, _Futalognkosaurus_ and _Argentinosaurus_ , which were scored for only 18.5% and 12.6% of the available characters, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). _Dreadnoughtus_ therefore offers important new osteological data for future investigations of the anatomy, biomechanics and evolution of the most massive land animals that have ever existed.',\n",
       "  'We conducted a phylogenetic analysis to assess the affinities of _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ within Titanosauria. We added the new Patagonian taxon to a recently-published matrix of 70 sauropod taxa and 341 morphological characters57 that contains a broad diversity of titanosaurian and non-titanosaurian titanosauriform genera, including the gigantic form _Argentinosaurus_. We also added _Futalognkosaurus_ to the matrix (the scoring of which was based on the description by Calvo et al.3 and is presented in the Supplementary Information) to more thoroughly investigate relationships between _Dreadnoughtus_ and other giant titanosaurians. We analysed the augmented matrix using the methods outlined in Carballido and Sander57. Specifically, the multistate characters 12, 58, 95, 96, 102, 106, 108, 115, 116, 119, 120, 154, 164, 213, 216, 232, 233, 234, 235, 256, 267, 298, 299 and 301 were treated as ordered and the matrix was subjected to a heuristic search in TNT (Tree Analysis Using New Technology) v. 1.158 (1,000 replicates of Wagner trees, random addition sequence, tree bisection reconnection branch swapping algorithm, ten trees saved per replicate). The initial trial yielded ten most parsimonious trees of 1,028 steps, the strict consensus of which recovered numerous taxa traditionally considered to be basal titanosauriforms as members of Titanosauria and provided little resolution within Lithostrotia (Supplementary Fig. 19).\\nBased on numerous aspects of its morphology, the titanosaurian affinities of _Dreadnoughtus_ are not in doubt; the aim of our analysis was therefore to ascertain the position of the new taxon within Titanosauria. Consequently, in an attempt to better resolve titanosaurian interrelationships, we inspected the matrix using the program TAXEQ3 (Safe Taxonomic Reduction Based on Taxonomic Equivalence59). The TAXEQ3 examination did not find taxa that could be safely deleted via safe taxonomic reduction, but did underscore the high proportion of missing data in the matrix. Although _Dreadnoughtus_ lacked only 42.5% of the available character information, 47 (of 72 total) taxa lacked more than 50% of these data. We reanalysed the matrix after pruning 18 of the 20 fragmentary and unstable taxa pruned by Carballido and Sander57, retaining _Andesaurus_ (to define the node-based clade Titanosauria) and _Argentinosaurus_ (another giant titanosaurian). This second iteration recovered 30 most parsimonious trees of 943 steps. The strict consensus of these trees (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 20; Consistency Index = 0.42, Retention Index = 0.76, Rescaled Consistency Index = 0.32) yields considerably greater resolution within Titanosauria and posits _Dreadnoughtus_ as a non-lithostrotian titanosaur more derived than _Andesaurus_ , _Epachthosaurus_ , _Argentinosaurus_ and lognkosaurians (i.e., _Futalognkosaurus_ , _Mendozasaurus_) but less derived than all other Campanian–Maastrichtian titanosaurs.',\n",

       "  'Among many other elements, the _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ holotype (MPM-PV 1156) includes the complete left humerus and femur. Because the minimum midshaft circumferences of these bones have been found to scale with body mass in quadrupedal terrestrial tetrapods13,48,49, the preservation of these elements in MPM-PV 1156 permits an estimate of the mass of this specimen. The midshaft circumference of the humerus is 785 mm and that of the femur is 910 mm. Using the scaling equation recently proposed by Campione and Evans49 (logBM = 2.749 * logCH+F − 1.104, where BM is body mass and CH+F is combined humeral and femoral circumference), these values yield an estimated body mass of 59,291 kg (~59.3 metric tons, or 65.4 short tons) for this _Dreadnoughtus_ individual. By comparison, the estimated masses of other medium- and large-bodied titanosaur specimens for which humeral and femoral shaft circumferences have been published are as follows: _Opisthocoelicaudia_ ZPAL MgD-I/4835, 25,418 kg; _Alamosaurus_ TMM 41541-160, 35,164 kg; and _Elaltitan_ PVL 46288, 42,798 kg. Additionally, Benson et al.13 provide an estimate of 38,139 kg for _Futalognkosaurus_3, based on an undescribed humerus and femur. Large individuals of the diplodocid _Diplodocus_ (USNM 10865) and the brachiosaurid _Giraffatitan_ (HMN SII) have been estimated at 14,813 and 34,003 kg, respectively, using the same equation13,49. It therefore appears that the _Dreadnoughtus schrani_ holotype was considerably more massive than most other titanosaurian specimens and indeed, most other sauropods.\\nDue primarily to uncertainty in the morphology of the cervical series, it is currently not possible to definitively establish the total body length of _Dreadnoughtus_. Nevertheless, the elongate nature of the two preserved cervical vertebrae implies that the taxon had a long neck, more similar to those of titanosaurs such as _Futalognkosaurus_3 and _Rapetosaurus_18 than to comparatively short-necked forms such as _Isisaurus_38 and _Mendozasaurus_62. The centrum of the complete posterior cervical vertebra of MPM-PV 1156 is 113 cm in anteroposterior length. Assuming that the neck proportions of _Dreadnoughtus_ were similar to those of _Futalognkosaurus_3,63 and that this complete _Dreadnoughtus_ cervical vertebra corresponds to the ninth vertebra in the series, this yields a neck length of approximately 11.3 m for MPM-PV 1156.\\nThe holotype of _Tapuiasaurus_ (MZSP-PV 807) is the only adult titanosaurian specimen known to preserve a complete skull associated with appendicular elements41. Using the radius length of MPM-PV 1156 (95 cm) and scaling up from the relative lengths of the skull and radius in _Tapuiasaurus_ , we estimate the length of the mostly unknown skull of this _Dreadnoughtus_ specimen at 88 cm. Thus, the total combined length of the skull and neck of MPM-PV 1156 is estimated at roughly 12.2 m.\\nThe remainder of the axial skeleton is well-represented in _Dreadnoughtus_ , permitting more precise estimates of its length. The majority of titanosaurs for which the dorsal series is completely known (e.g., _Futalognkosaurus_ , _Rapetosaurus_ , _Trigonosaurus_ , _Overosaurus_) possess ten vertebrae in this region3,18,39,64; with 11 dorsal vertebrae, _Opisthocoelicaudia_ is the only known exception in this regard35. We therefore assume that ten dorsal vertebrae were present in _Dreadnoughtus_. The only described titanosaurian specimen with a completely preserved caudal series is the holotype of _Opisthocoelicaudia_ (ZPAL MgD-I/48); this includes 34 vertebrae35. Nevertheless, evidence indicates that the tail may have been longer in some other titanosaurian taxa. For example, exceptional specimens of _Epachthosaurus_ (UNPSJB-PV 920) and _Alamosaurus_ (USNM 15560) preserve the first 30 and 29 caudal vertebrae, respectively, all of which are strongly procoelous61,65. In both of these caudal sequences, the posterior-most preserved vertebra is clearly not the terminal caudal vertebra; moreover, Wilson et al.66 demonstrated that the posterior-most ~seven to eight caudal vertebrae of at least some titanosaurs were biconvex. Furthermore, an as-yet undescribed titanosaurian skeleton from northern Patagonia is reputed to include approximately 65 caudal vertebrae67. Taking all of the above into account, we provisionally estimate that the complete caudal series of _Dreadnoughtus_ would have included approximately 40 vertebrae. Digital reconstruction of the dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebral sequences that incorporates these assumptions (Supplementary Fig. 9) yields a combined length of 13.8 m for these parts of the axial skeleton. When added to the skull and neck length estimated above, this yields an approximate total body length of 26 m for MPM-PV 1156.',\n",
       "  'We quantified the skeletal completeness of _Dreadnoughtus_ and other enormous titanosaurs using the following method. (We chose to devise an un-weighted metric that counts the presence of each element equally. See Mannion and Upchurch68 for an alternative, weighted method.) First, we used material of the most completely known titanosaurs of any size (e.g., _Epachthosaurus_ , _Nemegtosaurus_ , _Opisthocoelicaudia_ , _Overosaurus_ , _Rapetosaurus_ , _Saltasaurus_ , _Tapuiasaurus_ , _Trigonosaurus_) to estimate the total number of bones in a representative titanosaurian skeleton at 256 (Supplementary Table 2). We then counted the total number of non-duplicated elements preserved between both known _Dreadnoughtus_ specimens (MPM-PV 1156 and MPM-PV 3546) at 116 and used the literature to tally the elements preserved for five other giant titanosaurs: ‘ _Antarctosaurus_ ’ _giganteus_ (six bones)8, _Argentinosaurus_ (13 bones)6, _Futalognkosaurus_ (39 bones)3, _Paralititan_ (20 bones)7,69 and _Puertasaurus_ (four bones)9. These numbers were then divided by 256 to yield completeness percentages for each taxon (Supplementary Table 2).\\nBecause the six titanosaurs under consideration are represented exclusively (‘ _A_.’ _giganteus_ , _Argentinosaurus_ , _Futalognkosaurus_ , _Paralititan_ , _Puertasaurus_) or almost exclusively (_Dreadnoughtus_) by postcranial bones, we then explored the postcranial completeness of each taxon. We calculated the total number of postcranial elements expected in a representative titanosaur and then counted all such bones for each taxon in question. We divided the elements preserved by the elements expected to produce percentages of postcranial completeness for each titanosaur (Supplementary Table 2).\\nFinally, because, from a morphological standpoint, the preservation of one bilaterally symmetrical element is effectively as informative as is the preservation of both, we calculated what we term the ‘mirrored postcranial completeness’ of each of these giant titanosaurs (Supplementary Table 2). When determining mirrored postcranial completeness, bilateral elements are treated as equivalents; in other words, if at least one of a pair of bilaterally symmetrical bones is preserved in a given taxon, that element is counted as fully preserved in that taxon. (As an example, in mirrored postcranial completeness, the humerus of _Dreadnoughtus_ is treated as completely represented, even though only the left humerus of this titanosaur is actually preserved.)',\n",

       "  'Polished pebbles occasionally found within skeletons of giant herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs are very likely to be gastroliths (stomach stones). Here, we show that based on feeding experiments with ostriches and comparative data for relative gastrolith mass in birds, sauropod gastroliths do not represent the remains of an avian-style gastric mill. Feeding experiments with farm ostriches showed that bird gastroliths experience fast abrasion in the gizzard and do not develop a polish. Relative gastrolith mass in sauropods (gastrolith mass much less than 0.1% of body mass) is at least an order of magnitude less than that in ostriches and other herbivorous birds (gastrolith mass approximates 1% of body mass), also arguing against the presence of a gastric mill in sauropods. Sauropod dinosaurs possibly compensated for their limited oral processing and gastric trituration capabilities by greatly increasing food retention time in the digestive system. Gastrolith clusters of some derived theropod dinosaurs (oviraptorosaurs and ornithomimosaurs) compare well with those of birds, suggesting that the gastric mill evolved in the avian stem lineage.\\n**Keywords:** gizzard, digestion, sauropod dinosaurs, extant birds, gastroliths',\n",
       "  'Sauropod dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were the largest herbivores ever to have evolved, commonly exceeding body masses of 30 tons or more (Seebacher 2001). In many forms, the small head and weak dentition appear ill suited for oral processing of the enormous quantity of plant matter required to support their high growth rates (Sander 2000; Erickson _et al_. 2001), if not endothermic metabolism (Padian & Horner 2004).\\nPolished pebbles occasionally found with sauropod skeletons are generally interpreted as gastroliths or stomach stones, i.e. stones ingested voluntarily by the animal and retained in its digestive tract (Janensch 1929; Christiansen 1996; Ratkevich 1998; Bonaparte & Mateus 1999; Sanders _et al_. 2001). Polish of stones found in association with sauropods ranges from dull to fatty or waxy to a silky or even a highly reflective surface (figure 1 _a_ ,_b_ ; Gillette 1994; Wings 2004). The pebbles are also believed to have comprised a gastric mill of the kind employed by modern birds (Galton 1986; Christiansen 1996; Upchurch & Barrett 2000; Barrett & Upchurch 2005; Fastovsky & Weishampel 2005). Although our taphonomic and sedimentological research (Wings 2004) supports the view that these pebbles are gastroliths and not just a sedimentological phenomenon as proposed by some authors (Calvo 1994; Lucas 2000), we here provide evidence that sauropods lacked a gastric mill.',\n",
       "  '[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2197205_rspb20063763f01.jpg)\\nOpen in a new tab\\nGenuine and alleged gastroliths from sauropods and ostriches. All images have the same scale. (_a_) Sauropod gastroliths from _Cedarosaurus_ (Denver Museum of Natural History 39045). Note that some pebbles are composed of relatively soft sandstone and that even the quartz pebbles exhibit a dull surface, except where covered by diagenetic hematite coating. (_b_) Typical alleged sauropod gastroliths, composed of quartz and exhibiting a high polish (Yale Peabody Museum 1782). (_c_) Natural ostrich gastrolith composed of white vein quartz (Institute of Palaeontology, University Bonn (IPB) R563). (_d_) Black chert pebbles before and after abrasion experiment (IPB R564). (_e_) Abrasion sequence of experimental granite samples (IPB R565) in the ostrich gizzards. Samples are from experiment illustrated in figure 2. Note that the general shape of the stones remained intact during the experiment and that the experimental gastroliths did not develop any polish. Numbers below specimens in (_c_), (_d_) and (_e_) indicate residence time in gizzard in days.\\nHerbivorous and granivorous birds, lacking oral processing capabilities, must rely on their gastric mill in the gizzard to efficiently triturate food stuff for hind gut fermentation (Gionfriddo & Best 1999). Other components of the avian gastric mill are strong, paired stomach muscles and a tough lining of the stomach consisting of a keratin-like substance forming a specialized tissue, koilin (Duke 1986). The number and mass of rocks in a gastric mill are important variables in the system. None of the components of the gastric mill except for gastroliths have the potential to fossilize, however.\\nTo test the hypotheses that sauropod dinosaurs possessed a bird-like gastric mill and that the polished pebbles found in association with some sauropod skeletons are its remains, we first investigated gastrolith properties and function in the largest herbivorous bird, the ostrich (_Struthio camelus_). In specifically designed feeding experiments, we assessed whether gastroliths develop a polish and how long they last in the gizzard. Second, we compared relative gastrolith mass data for ostriches, other birds and sauropod dinosaurs.\\nWe chose ostriches for our comparative research on the putative sauropod gastric mills for three reasons: (i) being birds, ostriches are the closest living relatives of sauropod dinosaurs, (ii) the diet of ostriches, fibrous plant matter, is a comparable diet to that assumed for sauropods (Upchurch & Barrett 2000; Barrett & Upchurch 2005; Fastovsky & Weishampel 2005), and (iii) ostriches possess a well-developed gastric mill in their gizzard with a known gastrolith function: triturating and mixing ingested plant foodstuff. Although sample material is abundant and easily accessible at ostrich farms, thus permitting statistical tests, no comprehensive study has been conducted on ostrich gastroliths before.\\nOstriches, like all ratites, lack a crop. Instead, foodstuff is stored and mixed with stomach juices in the sac-like proventriculus. The gastro-intestinal tract leads into the second part of the stomach, the ventriculus or gizzard, which contains the food and the majority of the gastroliths. The remaining gastroliths are found in the proventriculus. The massive muscle packages that flank the gizzard contract two to three times per minute in ostriches, generating a continuous (and audible) movement of the stones grinding up foodstuff.',\n",
       "  'Different rock types were offered to German farm ostriches and recovered after residence times from 1 to 60 days (figures 1 and 2). In November 2002, cubes of 2 cm side length of three rock types (limestone, granite and rose quartz) were presented to three groups of 1-year-old ostriches on the farm ‘Gemarkenhof’ near Remagen (western Germany), with each group being offered one rock type only. Since stones are a normal part of their dietary uptake, the birds swallowed the stones deliberately. Each of the ostriches swallowed at least three stones of its designated rock type. Rose quartz was chosen because it has the same physical properties as the white vein quartz (of which most of the naturally acquired gastroliths consist), but can be separated from these by colour. In addition, polished black chert pebbles were offered to a fourth group of ostriches. Since all birds were later slaughtered during normal farm operations, the stones were retrieved at irregular intervals. Once the stomachs (proventriculus and gizzard) were removed, the stomach contents were collected, washed and screened, and the experimental rocks were separated and examined for mass loss, surface modifications and shape change.\\n#### Figure 2.\\n[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2197205_rspb20063763f02.jpg)\\nOpen in a new tab\\nResults of the gastrolith-feeding experiments with German farm ostriches (_Struthio camelus_) using three different rock types: limestone; granite; and rose quartz. The mass of the fed stones is plotted against the number of days of residence in the stomach. Each data point represents one slaughtered animal that contained a sample of known residence time. Rose quartz was by far the most resistant rock type, followed by granite, limestone being destroyed almost immediately. Number of days between intake of experimentally prepared gastroliths and eventual slaughter was decided independently by the farmer. Hence, duration of the interval between samples is not of equal length.',\n",
       "  'More than 300 stomachs of slaughtered ostriches of known body mass from two different groups of free-ranging farm animals in Germany and South Africa were sampled for a statistical analysis of absolute and relative gastrolith mass (see electronic supplementary material for details). To augment the ostrich data and to detect scaling effects, we added reliable data for 26 species of birds compiled from ornithological literature. The data came from insectivorous, omnivorous and herbivorous bird species belonging to several families (see electronic supplementary material for details).\\nDespite the hundreds of sauropod skeletons found worldwide, data for gastrolith mass in these dinosaurs is scarce, in particular because only very few specimens preserve any. We analysed the three sauropod finds with the highest gastrolith masses, i.e. _Seismosaurus hallorum_ (Gillette 1994), _Cedarosaurus weiskopfae_ (Sanders _et al_. 2001) and _Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis_ (Bonaparte & Mateus 1999). Data for the first two sauropods were collected from the literature and calibrated during museum visits, the mass for the latter was kindly provided by O. Mateus (2004, personal communication; see electronic supplementary material for details).\\nEstimates for sauropod body mass were derived from Seebacher (2001) who used graphic reconstructions to produce volume estimates that were transformed into mass estimates.',\n",
       "  'More than half of the mass of the limestone cubes was lost from the ostrich gizzard after 24 h, a result of the acidic environment. Consequently, no later sample contained any trace of the limestone cubes. Granite, although very resistant to weathering, was rather quickly eroded in the highly destructive environment of the gizzard (figure 1). The lowest abrasion rate was observed in rose quartz: after 60 days, about 15% of the mass of the stones was eroded (figure 2).\\nShape change resulting from the abrasion experiments was limited: even after strong weight loss of 55.7% (granite sample after 50 days), the cube shape of the sample remained recognizable (figure 1 _e_). Owing to the high abrasion rate, initially smooth cut surfaces became rough, and the samples maintained this rough surface throughout the abrasion experiments. Abrasion rate was obviously much too high for the samples to develop a polish. Similarly, the polished black chert pebbles became dull within a day (figure 1 _d_).\\nFrom the 15% weight loss within 60 days residence time in the gizzard, the total survival time of quartz pebbles with a typical diameter of 2 cm can be extrapolated to _ca_ 1 year in the ostrich stomach. As ostriches live for 30–40 years (Folch 1992), our experiments explain why the birds need a constant supply of rocks.\\nThe dull surface of sample gastroliths is in accordance with natural ostrich gastroliths from the same stomachs that never showed a polish (figure 1 _c_). The implication of our experiments is that natural stones taken up by a bird will not develop any polish in its gastric mill. This result is consistent with observations for many other herbivorous birds.',\n",
       "  'In both sample groups of ostriches, gastrolith mass correlated closely with body mass, and relative gastrolith mass showed a tight normal distribution around a mean gastrolith mass of 1.05% of body mass (figure 3). In the data from other bird taxa, there is also a clear relationship between body mass and gastrolith mass (figure 4). Herbivorous species have the highest proportion of gastroliths in the stomach, repeatedly reaching 1% of body mass, independently of size which spans four orders of magnitude (figure 4).\\n#### Figure 3.\\n[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2197205_rspb20063763f03.jpg)\\nOpen in a new tab\\nGastrolith masses of South African and German free-ranging farm ostriches. Both groups exhibit a normal distribution of data. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test gave an asymptotic significance of 0.414 for German ostrich gastrolith mass and an asymptotic significance of 0.084 for South African ostrich gastrolith mass. While the South African birds were two to four months younger at slaughter, and therefore had a lower mean body mass, the proportions of gastrolith and body mass is almost identical in both groups.\\n#### Figure 4.\\n[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2197205_rspb20063763f04.jpg)\\nOpen in a new tab\\nRelationship of body mass to gastrolith mass in birds and dinosaurs. Data were compiled for 27 bird species of several families (ostriches, wild birds and domesticated; see electronic supplementary material) as well as for the theropod _Caudipteryx_ and the three sauropod finds with the highest mass of associated gastroliths (type specimens of _Seismosaurus_ , _Cedarosaurus_ and _Dinheirosaurus_). Note that values of relative gastrolith mass in sauropods lie well below the regression line for birds and the _Caudipteryx_ data.\\nAllometric comparison of sauropod gastrolith data with that of living birds indicates that sauropod relative gastrolith mass was at least one order of magnitude lower than in herbivorous birds (figure 4). The highest gastrolith mass recorded for any sauropod is _ca_ 15 kg of gastroliths found associated with the skeleton of _Seismosaurus_. These compare with a body mass estimate of approximately 50 000 kg (Seebacher 2001) and thus account for only 0.03% of body mass (figure 4). Based on the ratio derived from extant ostriches, a gastrolith mass in excess of 500 kg would be predicted for _Seismosaurus_. Even if a very conservative mass estimate of 30 000 kg is used, a prediction of 300 kg of gastroliths would result.',\n",
       "  'We reject the hypothesis that sauropod dinosaurs had an avian-style gastric mill, and that polished pebbles occasionally found with sauropod skeletons are its remains, for a number of reasons: the high abrasion rate and the lack of polish in bird gastroliths (figures 1 and 2); the rare occurrence of gastroliths in sauropod fossils; and, where present, the extremely low values of relative gastrolith mass in sauropods compared with birds (figure 4).\\nWe are aware of the dangers of extrapolating over four orders of magnitude from a 89 kg ostrich to a 50 000 kg sauropod, but note that the ratio of body mass to gastrolith mass observed in birds also includes a body mass range of four orders of magnitude, from a 17 g robin to a 89 kg ostrich. Several other methods for estimating sauropod mass are reviewed in Seebacher (2001). Although there is considerable variation between these estimates, they are all of the same order of magnitude, not affecting the extremely low ratios of gastrolith mass to body mass in sauropods calculated in this study.\\nCompared to the estimated dimensions of an average sauropod stomach, the mass and number of the discovered gastroliths would have been negligible for stomach function as a gastric mill. Other characteristics also argue against such a function, such as the size of the pebbles (very small compared with the dimensions of the throat and the total body size of the sauropods) and the rock type of the gastroliths. For example, 31% of the _Cedarosaurus_ gastroliths are composed of soft rocks such as sandstones and siltstones (Sanders _et al_. 2001), which could not have served efficiently as grinding agents.\\nIf sauropods did indeed employ a gastric mill, many reasonably complete skeletons should be accompanied by very noticeable amounts of pebbles or even cobbles. Hypothetically, strong under-representation of gastroliths could be, in part, attributable to taphonomic processes such as scavenging by theropod dinosaurs, which preferentially could have removed the digestive tract (as seen in modern scavengers) or the dropping of gastroliths out of floating carcasses (as observed in an experiment on ostriches; Wings 2003). However, some sauropod fossil deposits are autochthonous (e.g. Howe Quarry; Michelis 2004), and our extensive fieldwork revealed that sauropod gastroliths are an extremely rare occurrence (see electronic supplementary material). Also, there are other groups of dinosaurs (see below) and further fossil vertebrates (primitive diapsids, plesiosaurs, crocodilians and birds) that regularly preserve gastroliths (Whittle & Everhart 2000; Wings 2004; Wings in press) despite having been subject to similar taphonomic processes as sauropods. The presence of isolated polished clasts in sauropod-bearing formations is not necessarily a result of the deposition of former gastroliths but has also been attributed to transport in hyperconcentrated flows (Zaleha & Wiesemann 2005). Consequently, such isolated clasts should not be called ‘gastroliths’ but rather ‘exoliths’ (i.e. exotic rocks in fine-grained sediments which may show a high polish and which potentially—but not necessarily—were former gastroliths; Wings in press).\\nSince there is no evidence for gastric mills in sauropod dinosaurs, another explanation regarding occurrence and function of sauropod gastroliths should be sought. Possible alternatives include accidental or pathologic ingestion, or intentional ingestion for mineral uptake, especially calcium supply (Wings in press). Similar to what has been observed in several extant bird taxa (Gionfriddo & Best 1999; Wings 2004), stones might have been swallowed indiscriminately. While the calcium-rich limestone would have been quickly dissolved, acid-resistant rock types, such as quartz, could have remained in the stomach and may have accumulated as gastroliths, thereby developing polish through prolonged exposure to mild abrasion.\\nThe lack of a gastric mill also raises the question of how sauropods processed their plant food. Like all strictly herbivorous tetrapods, sauropod dinosaurs needed bacterial fermentation to access the nutrients in the plant cell walls. Fermentation, which probably occurred in specialized parts of the hindgut (Farlow 1987; Dunham _et al_. 1989; Marshall & Stevens 2000), would have been greatly speeded up by foodstuff having been reduced to small particles. While the robust, broad-crowned teeth of some basal sauropods and early macronarians (e.g. _Camarasaurus_ and _Brachiosaurus_) indicate some oral processing capability (Upchurch & Barrett 2000; Barrett & Upchurch 2005; Chatterjee & Zheng 2005), the narrow-crowned, pencil-shaped teeth of Jurassic diplodocids and derived titanosauromorphs are inconsistent with oral processing (Upchurch & Barrett 2000; Barrett & Upchurch 2005). Sauropods possibly secured sufficient nutrient uptake by extremely prolonged food retention times permitted by their large body size (Farlow 1987; Clauss & Hummel 2005).\\nThere are three other dinosaur groups that are regularly found with gastrolith clusters: the ornithischian dinosaur _Psittacosaurus_ (Xu 1997; You & Dodson 2004), ornithomimids (Kobayashi _et al_. 1999; Ji _et al_. 2003; Barrett 2005), and basal oviraptorosaurs (Ji _et al_. 1998), raising the question whether these may represent the remains of a gastric mill. All described specimens of the feathered Lower Cretaceous oviraptorosaur _Caudipteryx_ have well-defined clusters of gastroliths in the abdominal region of the skeletons (Ji _et al_. 1998). These clusters are composed of pebbles which closely resemble bird gastroliths in size and composition (O. Wings 2003, personal observation on two National Geological Museum of China specimens: NGMC-97-4-A and NGMC-97-9-A). For these specimens, we estimate a gastrolith mass/body mass ratio of 1.25% (see electronic supplementary material), which is in remarkable agreement with the ratio in living birds, suggesting strongly that _Caudipteryx_ had an avian-style gastric mill. Gastrolith-bearing specimens of the ornithomimid theropod _Sinornithomimus_ (Kobayashi & Lü 2003) appear to have a similarly high relative gastrolith mass, which has been interpreted as evidence for a gastric mill (Kobayashi & Lü 2003) and a herbivorous diet (Barrett 2005).\\nThe gastrolith clusters in _Caudipteryx_ and other derived non-avian theropods suggest that the gizzard is not an autapomorphy of crown-group birds, but rather evolved much earlier along the avian stem lineage, repeating a now well-known pattern of supposed ‘bird’ characteristics appearing phylogenetically earlier than in _Archaeopteryx_. None of the specimens of the _Urvogel_ preserve gastroliths, but some other Mesozoic bird skeletons do (Zhou & Zhang 2003; Zhou _et al_. 2004), although the record is patchy and influenced by taphonomic loss of gastrolith and possible seasonal dietary shifts (Zhou _et al_. 2004). Since _Psittacosaurus_ is a derived ornithischian, its gastrolith clusters are most parsimoniously interpreted as homoplastic to those of derived non-avian theropods.',\n",

Image credit: Wei _et al_., doi: 10.1038/s41598-025-09796-0.\\nThe newly-described species lived in what is now southwestern China some 147 million years ago (Late Jurassic epoch).\\nScientifically named _Tongnanlong zhimingi_ , this sauropod dinosaur was about 23 to 28 m (75.5-92 feet) long.\\n“Sauropods were gigantic, quadrupedal herbivores and the largest terrestrial dinosaurs ever existed,” said Dr. Xuefang Wei from the Chengdu Center of China Geological Survey and colleagues.\\n“They appeared in the Late Triassic, achieved a global distribution by the Middle Jurassic, and finally died out at the end of the Late Cretaceous.”\\n“More than 150 genera have been identified, including over 20 genera from the Jurassic period in China.”\\n“The southwestern China is a key region that yields Middle-Late Jurassic sauropod dinosaurs, particularly the Sichuan Basin,” they added.\\n“The sauropod fauna from the Middle-Late Jurassic Sichuan Basin has previously been considered an endemic fauna which differs from the contemporaneous sauropod faunae from the Pangean terrestrial faunae.”\\n“This distribution has often been interpreted by the East Asian Isolation hypothesis, which occurred during the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.”\\n“However, this hypothesis is challenged by more phylogenetic analyses and studies of neosauropod dinosaurs from China and mamenchisaurid dinosaurs discovered from Africa which support the idea that they were distributed globally during the Middle Jurassic.”\\nThe holotype specimen of _Tongnanlong zhimingi_ was excavated from a building site in the Tongnan district of Chongqing area, the Sichuan Basin.\\nIt includes three dorsal and six caudal vertebrae, scapula, coracoid, and some hindlimb bones.\\n“Our field work shows that the fossiliferous site belongs to the lower portion of the Upper Jurassic Suining Formation, overlying by the Quaternary deposits,” the paleontologists said.\\n“The Suining Formation consists of purplish red mudstone and sandstone.”\\n“Abundant invertebrate fossils are known from this formation, especially ostracods and stoneworts, along with some freshwater bivalves, conchostracans.”\\n“A few vertebrates are also known from this formation, such as fish _Ceratodus szechuanensis_ , turtle _Plesiochelys tatsuensis_ , and dinosaur _Mamenchisaurus anyuensis_.”\\nThe team’s anatomical and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that _Tongnanlong zhimingi_ belonged to a family of sauropod dinosaurs called Mamenchisauridae.\\n“Mamenchisauridae was distributed globally in the Late Jurassic rather than an endemic fauna which was previously considered limited to East Asia,” the researchers concluded.\\n“ _Tongnanlong zhimingi_ enriches the diversity of eusauropods and provides new information on the understanding of the sauropod diversity and evolutionary trend from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Jurassic when their bodies became larger.”\\nTheir paper was published July 10 in the journal _Scientific Reports_.\\n_____\\nX.

       "  'The long-necked dinosaurs, sauropods, are famous for their extreme body sizes, evolving body masses several times greater than the next-heaviest terrestrial animals, elephant-like and rhinoceros- like mammals and ‘duck-billed’ dinosaurs. The pace of sauropod discovery has been exponential in recent decades, resulting in the recognition of sauropods as a global, ecologically diverse group of herbivorous dinosaurs comprising over 250 known species1. However, limitations due to missing data from their patchy fossil record have so far limited studies of sauropod body-size evolution to less than half their known diversity1. Here, I present models to confidently predict unknown limb-bone measurements in sauropods, resulting in a dataset 50% larger than previously assembled. Leveraging the emerging consilience among body mass estimation methods for fossil tetrapods, I then map sauropod body mass evolution through time in a phylogenetic context. Likelihood-based ancestral state reconstruction reveals that sauropods convergently surpassed maximum terrestrial mammalian body mass at least three dozen times over the course of 100 million years, on at least six landmasses and in at least five ecomorphologically disparate clades. Sauropod maximum body mass rapidly increased early in their evolutionary history from under 5,000 kg before levelling off around 40,000 kg (with notable exceptions)2, in a pattern similar to that observed in terrestrial mammals3.\\n* Previous article in issue\\n* Next article in issue  \\nRecommended articles',\n",

       "  'Sauropod dinosaurs have been found in sediments dating to most of the Cretaceous Period on all major Mesozoic landmasses, but this record is spatiotemporally uneven, even in relatively well-explored North American sediments. Within the 80 million-year-span of the Cretaceous, no definitive sauropod occurrences are known in North America from two ca. 20–25 million-year-long gaps, one from approximately the Berriasian–Barremian and the other from the mid-Cenomanian–late Campanian. Herein, we present an undescribed specimen that was collected in the middle part of the twentieth century that expands the known spatiotemporal distribution of Early Cretaceous North American sauropods, partially filling the earlier gap. The material is from the Berriasian–Valanginian-aged (ca. 139 Ma) Chilson Member of the Lakota Formation of South Dakota and appears to represent the only non-titanosauriform from the Cretaceous of North America or Asia. It closely resembles _Camarasaurus_ and may represent a form closely related to that genus that persisted across the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary.\\nKeywords::\\n* sauropod\\n* dinosaur\\n* Morrison Formation\\n* Lakota Formation',\n",

Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads (relative to the rest of their body), and four thick, pillar-like legs. They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land. Well-known genera include _Alamosaurus_ , _Apatosaurus_ , _Argentinosaurus_ , _Brachiosaurus_ , _Brontosaurus_ , _Camarasaurus_ , _Diplodocus,_ and _Mamenchisaurus_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-4)\\nThe oldest known unequivocal sauropod dinosaurs are known from the Early Jurassic.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-APPLallensacketal-5) _Isanosaurus_ and _Antetonitrus_ were originally described as Triassic sauropods,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-7) but their age, and in the case of _Antetonitrus_ also its sauropod status, were subsequently questioned.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-8)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-APPLallensacketal-5)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-9) Sauropod-like sauropodomorph tracks from the Fleming Fjord Formation (Greenland) might, however, indicate the occurrence of the group in the Late Triassic.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-APPLallensacketal-5) By the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), sauropods had become widespread (especially the diplodocids and brachiosaurids). By the Late Cretaceous, one group of sauropods, the titanosaurs, had replaced all others and had a near-global distribution. However, as with all other non-avian dinosaurs alive at the time, the titanosaurs died out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Fossilised remains of sauropods have been found on every continent, including Antarctica.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Novas2009-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Riffenburgh2007-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-CrameLondon1989-13)\\nThe name Sauropoda was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, and is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning \"lizard foot\".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Marsh1878-14) Sauropods are one of the most recognizable groups of dinosaurs, and have become a fixture in popular culture due to their impressive size.\\nComplete sauropod fossil finds are extremely rare. Many species, especially the largest, are known only from isolated and disarticulated bones. Many near-complete specimens lack heads, tail tips and limbs.',\n",
       "  '[edit]\\nSauropods were herbivorous (plant-eating), usually quite long-necked[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-15) quadrupeds (four-legged), often with spatulate (spatula-shaped: broad at the tip, narrow at the neck) teeth. They had tiny heads, massive bodies, and most had long tails. Their hind legs were thick, straight, and powerful, ending in club-like feet with five toes, though only the inner three (or in some cases four) bore claws. Their forelimbs were rather more slender and typically ended in pillar-like hands built for supporting weight; often only the thumb bore a claw. Many illustrations of sauropods in the flesh miss these facts, inaccurately depicting sauropods with hooves capping the claw-less digits of the feet, or more than three claws or hooves on the hands. The proximal caudal vertebrae are extremely diagnostic \"Diagnosis \\\\(taxonomy\\\\)\") for sauropods.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-veneno-desc-16)',\n",
       "  \"[edit]\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Longest_dinosaurs2.svg)Size comparison of selected giant sauropod dinosaurs\\nThe sauropods' most defining characteristic was their size. Even the dwarf sauropods (perhaps 5 to 6 metres (16 to 20 ft) long) were counted among the largest animals in their ecosystem. Their only real competitors in terms of size are the rorquals, such as the blue whale. But, unlike whales, sauropods were primarily terrestrial animals.\\nTheir body structure did not vary as much as other dinosaurs, perhaps due to size constraints, but they displayed ample variety. Some, like the diplodocids, possessed tremendously long tails, which they may have been able to crack like a whip as a signal or to deter or injure predators,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-17) or to make sonic booms.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-SN00-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-19) _Supersaurus_ , at 33 to 34 metres (108 to 112 ft) long,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-LHW07-20) was the longest sauropod known from reasonably complete remains, but others, like the old record holder, _Diplodocus_ , were also extremely long. The holotype (and now lost) vertebra of _Amphicoelias fragillimus_ (now _Maraapunisaurus_) may have come from an animal 58 metres (190 ft) long;[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-carpenter2006-21) its vertebral column would have been substantially longer than that of the blue whale. However, research published in 2015 speculated that the size estimates of _A. fragillimus_ may have been highly exaggerated.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Amphi-wrong-22) The longest dinosaur known from reasonable fossils material is probably _Argentinosaurus huinculensis_ with length estimates of 35 to 36 metres (115 to 118 ft) according to the most recent researches.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24) However the giant _Barosaurus_ specimen BYU 9024 might have been even larger reaching lengths of 45–48 meters (148–157 ft).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:2-25) Others, like the brachiosaurids, were extremely tall, with high shoulders and extremely long necks. The tallest sauropod was the giant _Barosaurus_ specimen at 22 m (72 ft) tall.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23) By comparison, the giraffe, the tallest of all living land animals, is only 4.8 to 5.6 metres (16 to 18 ft) tall.\\nThe best evidence indicates that the most massive were _Argentinosaurus_ (65 to 80 metric tons (72 to 88 short tons)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Argen_Antar-26)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24)), _Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum_ (60 to 80 metric tons or 66 to 88 short tons[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24)), the giant _Barosaurus_ specimen (60-80+ metric tons[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:2-25)) and _Patagotitan_ with _Puertasaurus_ (50 to 55 metric tons (49 to 54 long tons; 55 to 61 short tons)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:1-24)). Meanwhile, 'mega-sauropods' such as _Bruhathkayosaurus_ has long been scrutinized due to controversial debates on its validity, but recent photos re-surfacing in 2022 have legitimized it,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-27) allowing for more updated estimates that range between 110 to 170 metric tons (120 to 190 short tons), rivaling the blue whale in size.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Bruhathkayosaurus2023-28) The weight of _Amphicoelias fragillimus_ was estimated at 122.4 metric tons (120.5 long tons; 134.9 short tons) tons with lengths of up to nearly 60 meters (200 ft)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-carpenter2006-21) but 2015 research argued that these estimates were based on a diplodocid rather than the more modern rebbachisaurid, suggesting a much shorter length of 35–40 meters (115–130 ft) with mass between 80 and 120 metric tons (79 and 118 long tons; 88 and 132 short tons).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Amphi-wrong-22) Additional finds indicate a number of species likely reached or exceeded weights of 40 tons.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-C-29) The largest land animal alive today, the bush elephant, weighs no more than 10.4 metric tons (11.5 short tons).[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-probos_mass-30)\\nAmong the smallest sauropods were the primitive _Ohmdenosaurus_ (4 metres or 13 feet long), the dwarf titanosaur _Magyarosaurus_ (6 metres or 20 feet long), and the dwarf brachiosaurid _Europasaurus_ , which was 6.2 meters (20 ft) long as a fully-grown adult.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-P-31) Its small stature was probably the result of insular dwarfism occurring in a population of sauropods isolated on an island of the late Jurassic in what is now the Langenberg area of northern Germany.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Klein2011-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-JoachimQun2013-33) The diplodocoid sauropod _Brachytrachelopan_ was the shortest member of its group because of its unusually short neck. Unlike other sauropods, whose necks could grow to up to four times the length of their backs, the neck of _Brachytrachelopan_ was shorter than its backbone.\\nFossils from perhaps the largest dinosaur ever found were discovered in 2012 in the Neuquén Province of northwest Patagonia, Argentina. It is believed that they are from a titanosaur, which were amongst the largest sauropods.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-34)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-C-29)\\nOn or shortly before 29 March 2017 a sauropod footprint about 1.7 meters (5.6 feet) long was found at Walmadany in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-35) The report said that it was the biggest known yet. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated the size of the animal at 31 meters (102 feet) and 72 tonnes (79.4 short tons) based on the 1.75-meter (5.7-foot) long footprint.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-:0-23)\",\n",
       "  '[edit]\\nAs massive quadrupeds, sauropods developed specialized \"graviportal\" (weight-bearing) limbs. The hind feet were broad, and retained three claws in most species.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-36) Particularly unusual compared with other animals were the highly modified front feet (_manus \"Manus \\\\(zoology\\\\)\")_). The front feet of sauropods were very dissimilar from those of modern large quadrupeds, such as elephants. Rather than splaying out to the sides to create a wide foot as in elephants, the manus \"Manus \\\\(anatomy\\\\)\") bones of sauropods were arranged in fully vertical columns, with extremely reduced finger bones (though it is not clear if the most primitive sauropods, such as _Vulcanodon_ and _Barapasaurus_ , had such forefeet).[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Bonnan,_M.F._2003-37) The front feet were so modified in eusauropods that individual digits would not have been visible in life.\\nThe arrangement of the forefoot bone (_metacarpal_) columns in eusauropods was semi-circular, so sauropod forefoot prints are horseshoe-shaped. Unlike elephants, print evidence shows that sauropods lacked any fleshy padding to back the front feet, making them concave.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Bonnan,_M.F._2003-37) The only claw visible in most sauropods was the distinctive thumb claw (associated with digit I). Almost all sauropods had such a claw, though what purpose it served is unknown. The claw was largest (as well as tall and laterally flattened) in diplodocids, and very small in brachiosaurids, some of which seem to have lost the claw entirely based on trackway evidence.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-upchurch1994-38) Titanosaurs may have lost the thumb claw completely (with the exception of early forms, such as _Janenschia_).\\nTitanosaurs were most unusual among sauropods, as, across their history as a clade, they lost not just the external claw but also completely lost the digits of the front foot. Advanced titanosaurs had no digits or digit bones, and walked only on horseshoe-shaped \"stumps\" made up of the columnar metacarpal bones.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-apesteguia2005-39)\\nPrint evidence from Portugal shows that, in at least some sauropods (probably brachiosaurids), the bottom and sides of the forefoot column was likely covered in small, spiny scales, which left score marks in the prints.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-milan2005-40) In titanosaurs, the ends of the metacarpal bones that contacted the ground were unusually broad and squared-off, and some specimens preserve the remains of soft tissue covering this area, suggesting that the front feet were rimmed with some kind of padding in these species.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-apesteguia2005-39)\\nMatthew Bonnan[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-42) has shown that sauropod dinosaur long bones grew isometrically: that is, there was little to no change in shape as juvenile sauropods became gigantic adults. Bonnan suggested that this odd scaling pattern (most vertebrates show significant shape changes in long bones associated with increasing weight support) might be related to a stilt-walker principle (suggested by amateur scientist Jim Schmidt) in which the long legs of adult sauropods allowed them to easily cover great distances without changing their overall mechanics.',\n",
       "  '[edit]\\nAlong with other saurischian dinosaurs (such as theropods, including birds), sauropods had a system of air sacs, evidenced by indentations and hollow cavities in most of their vertebrae that had been invaded by them. Pneumatic, hollow bones are a characteristic feature of all sauropods.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-wedel2009-43) These air spaces reduced the overall weight of the massive necks that the sauropods had, and the air-sac system in general, allowing for a single-direction airflow through stiff lungs, made it possible for the sauropods to get enough oxygen.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2013-44) This adaptation would have advantaged sauropods particularly in the relatively low oxygen conditions of the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-OutOfThinAirPeterDouglasWard-45)\\nThe bird-like hollowing of sauropod bones was recognized early in the study of these animals, and, in fact, at least one sauropod specimen found in the 19th century (_Ornithopsis_) was originally misidentified as a pterosaur (a flying reptile) because of this.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2008-46)',\n",
       "  '[edit]\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AmpelosaurusDB.jpg)Reconstruction of _Ampelosaurus_\\nSome sauropods had armor \"Armour \\\\(zoology\\\\)\"). There were genera with small clubs \"Club \\\\(zoology\\\\)\") on their tails, a prominent example being _Shunosaurus_ , and several titanosaurs, such as _Saltasaurus_ and _Ampelosaurus_ , had small bony osteoderms covering portions of their bodies.',\n",
       "  \"[edit]\\nA study by Michael D'Emic and his colleagues from Stony Brook University found that sauropods evolved high tooth replacement rates to keep up with their large appetites. The study suggested that _Nigersaurus_ , for example, replaced each tooth every 14 days, _Camarasaurus_ replaced each tooth every 62 days, and _Diplodocus_ replaced each tooth once every 35 days.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-highttoothreplacementstudy-47) The scientists found qualities of the tooth affected how long it took for a new tooth to grow. _Camarasaurus_ 's teeth took longer to grow than those for _Diplodocus_ because they were larger.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-TheChristianScienceMonitorTeeth-48)\\nIt was also noted by D'Emic and his team that the differences between the teeth of the sauropods also indicated a difference in diet. _Diplodocus_ ate plants low to the ground and _Camarasaurus_ browsed leaves from top and middle branches. According to the scientists, the specializing of their diets helped the different herbivorous dinosaurs to coexist.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-highttoothreplacementstudy-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-TheChristianScienceMonitorTeeth-48)\",\n",
       "  \"[edit]\\nSauropod necks have been found at over 15 metres (49 ft) in length, a full six times longer than the world record giraffe neck.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2013-44) Enabling this were a number of essential physiological features. The dinosaurs' overall large body size and quadrupedal stance provided a stable base to support the neck, and the head was evolved to be very small and light, losing the ability to orally process food. By reducing their heads to simple harvesting tools that got the plants into the body, the sauropods needed less power to lift their heads, and thus were able to develop necks with less dense muscle and connective tissue. This drastically reduced the overall mass of the neck, enabling further elongation.\\nSauropods also had a great number of adaptations in their skeletal structure. Some sauropods had as many as 19 cervical vertebrae, whereas almost all mammals are limited to only seven. Additionally, each vertebra was extremely long and had a number of empty spaces in them which would have been filled only with air. An air-sac system connected to the spaces not only lightened the long necks, but effectively increased the airflow through the trachea, helping the creatures to breathe in enough air. By evolving vertebrae consisting of 60% air, the sauropods were able to minimize the amount of dense, heavy bone without sacrificing the ability to take sufficiently large breaths to fuel the entire body with oxygen.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2013-44) According to Kent Stevens, computer-modeled reconstructions of the skeletons made from the vertebrae indicate that sauropod necks were capable of sweeping out large feeding areas without needing to move their bodies, but were unable to be retracted to a position much above the shoulders for exploring the area or reaching higher.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-stevens2013-49)\\nAnother proposed function of the sauropods' long necks was essentially a radiator to deal with the extreme amount of heat produced from their large body mass. Considering that the metabolism would have been doing an immense amount of work, it would certainly have generated a large amount of heat as well, and elimination of this excess heat would have been essential for survival.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50) It has also been proposed that the long necks would have cooled the veins and arteries going to the brain, avoiding excessively heated blood from reaching the head. It was in fact found that the increase in metabolic rate resulting from the sauropods' necks was slightly more than compensated for by the extra surface area from which heat could dissipate.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2013-51)\",\n",
       "  '[edit]',\n",
       "  '[edit]\\nDental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) performed on a titanosauriform sauropod from the Turonian-aged Tamagawa Formation suggests that the sauropod fed on plant material that was softer than insect exoskeletons or mollusc shells, with the diet likely consisting of ferns and gymnosperms. The DMTA results also suggested that sauropods likely masticated more energetically than present-day lepidosaurs do.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-52)\\nWhen sauropods were first discovered, their immense size led many scientists to compare them with modern-day whales. Most studies in the 19th and early 20th centuries concluded that sauropods were too large to have supported their weight on land, and therefore that they must have been mainly aquatic. Most life restorations of sauropods in art through the first three quarters of the 20th century depicted them fully or partially immersed in water.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2004-53) This early notion was cast in doubt beginning in the 1950s, when a study by Kermack (1951) demonstrated that, if the animal were submerged in several metres of water, the pressure would be enough to fatally collapse the lungs and airway.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-kermack1951-54) However, this and other early studies of sauropod ecology were flawed in that they ignored a substantial body of evidence that the bodies of sauropods were heavily permeated with air sacs. In 1878, paleontologist E.D. Cope had even referred to these structures as \"floats\".\\nBeginning in the 1970s, the effects of sauropod air sacs on their supposed aquatic lifestyle began to be explored. Paleontologists such as Coombs and Bakker used this, as well as evidence from sedimentology and biomechanics, to show that sauropods were primarily terrestrial animals. In 2004, D.M. Henderson noted that, due to their extensive system of air sacs, sauropods would have been buoyant and would not have been able to submerge their torsos completely below the surface of the water; in other words, they would float, and would not have been in danger of lung collapse due to water pressure when swimming.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2004-53)\\nEvidence for swimming in sauropods comes from fossil trackways that have occasionally been found to preserve only the forefeet (manus) impressions. Henderson showed that such trackways can be explained by sauropods with long forelimbs (such as macronarians) floating in relatively shallow water deep enough to keep the shorter hind legs free of the bottom, and using the front limbs to punt \"Punt \\\\(boat\\\\)\") forward.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2004-53) However, due to their body proportions, floating sauropods would also have been very unstable and maladapted for extended periods in the water. This mode of aquatic locomotion, combined with its instability, led Henderson to refer to sauropods in water as \"tipsy punters\".[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2004-53)\\nWhile sauropods could therefore not have been aquatic as historically depicted, there is evidence that they preferred wet and coastal habitats. Sauropod footprints are commonly found following coastlines or crossing floodplains, and sauropod fossils are often found in wet environments or intermingled with fossils of marine organisms.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-henderson2004-53) A good example of this would be the massive Jurassic sauropod trackways found in lagoon deposits on Scotland\\'s Isle of Skye.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-55) Studies published in 2021 suggest sauropods could not inhabit polar regions. This study suggests they were largely confined to tropical areas and had metabolisms that were very different to those of other dinosaurs, perhaps intermediate between mammals and reptiles.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-56) New studies published by Taia Wyenberg-henzler in 2022 suggest that sauropods in North America declined due to undetermined reasons in regards to their niches and distribution during the end of the Jurassic and into the latest Cretaceous. Why this is remains unclear, but some similarities in feeding niches between iguanodontians, hadrosauroids and sauropods have been suggested and may have resulted in some competition. However, this cannot fully explain the full decline in distribution of sauropods, as competitive exclusion would have resulted in a much more rapid decline than what is shown in the fossil record. Moreover, it must be determined as to whether sauropod declines in North America was the result of a change in preferred flora that sauropods ate, climate, or other factors. It is also suggested in this same study that iguanodontians and hadrosauroids took advantage of recently vacated niches left by a decline in sauropod diversity during the late Jurassic and the Cretaceous in North America.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-57)',\n",

However, the makeup of the herds varied between species. Some bone beds, for example a site from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina, appear to show herds made up of individuals of various age groups, mixing juveniles and adults. However, a number of other fossil sites and trackways indicate that many sauropod species travelled in herds segregated by age, with juveniles forming herds separate from adults. Such segregated herding strategies have been found in species such as _Alamosaurus_ , _Bellusaurus_ and some diplodocids.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-myers&fiorillo2009-58)\\nIn a review of the evidence for various herd types, Myers and Fiorillo attempted to explain why sauropods appear to have often formed segregated herds. Studies of microscopic tooth wear show that juvenile sauropods had diets that differed from their adult counterparts, so herding together would not have been as productive as herding separately, where individual herd members could forage in a coordinated way. The vast size difference between juveniles and adults may also have played a part in the different feeding and herding strategies.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-myers&fiorillo2009-58)\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sauropod_juvenile.jpg)Cast of Toni, a juvenile _Brachiosaurus_ (restored as a diplodocid)\\nSince the segregation of juveniles and adults must have taken place soon after hatching, and combined with the fact that sauropod hatchlings were most likely precocial, Myers and Fiorillo concluded that species with age-segregated herds would not have exhibited much parental care.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-myers&fiorillo2009-58) On the other hand, scientists who have studied age-mixed sauropod herds suggested that these species may have cared for their young for an extended period before reaching adulthood.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-coria1994-59) A 2014 study suggested that the time from laying the egg to the time of the hatching was likely to have been between 65 and 82 days.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-60) Exactly how segregated versus age-mixed herding varied across different groups of sauropods is unknown. Further examples of gregarious behavior will need to be discovered from more sauropod species to detect possible distribution patterns.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-myers&fiorillo2009-58)\\nMultiple nesting sites discovered in Argentina and India contain 30-400 clutches of fossilized eggs that were found preserved, providing evidence of sauropod maternal care. Researchers suggest that sauropods might have settled in nesting grounds close to volcanic activity for geothermal incubation, in which the mothers keep their eggs warm. This behavior is similar to modern birds and reptiles who follow the same method.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-63)',\n",

Knight, 1911\\nSince early in the history of their study, scientists, such as Osborn, have speculated that sauropods could rear up on their hind legs, using the tail as the third 'leg' of a tripod.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-osborn1899-64) A skeletal mount depicting the diplodocid _Barosaurus lentus_ rearing up on its hind legs at the American Museum of Natural History is one illustration of this hypothesis. In a 2005 paper, Rothschild and Molnar reasoned that if sauropods had adopted a bipedal posture at times, there would be evidence of stress fractures in the forelimb 'hands'. However, none were found after they examined a large number of sauropod skeletons.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-rothschild&molnar-65)\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barosaurus_mount_1.jpg)Mounted skeleton of _Barosaurus lentus_ , depicted in a rearing tripodal stance\\nHeinrich Mallison (in 2009) was the first to study the physical potential for various sauropods to rear into a tripodal stance. Mallison found that some characters previously linked to rearing adaptations were actually unrelated (such as the wide-set hip bones of titanosaurs) or would have hindered rearing. For example, titanosaurs had an unusually flexible backbone, which would have decreased stability in a tripodal posture and would have put more strain on the muscles. Likewise, it is unlikely that brachiosaurids could rear up onto the hind legs, as their center of gravity was much farther forward than other sauropods, which would cause such a stance to be unstable.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-mallison2009-66)\\nDiplodocids, on the other hand, appear to have been well adapted for rearing up into a tripodal stance. Diplodocids had a center of mass directly over the hips, giving them greater balance on two legs. Diplodocids also had the most mobile necks of sauropods, a well-muscled pelvic girdle, and tail vertebrae with a specialised shape that would allow the tail to bear weight at the point it touched the ground. Mallison concluded that diplodocids were better adapted to rearing than elephants, which do so occasionally in the wild. He also argues that stress fractures in the wild do not occur from everyday behaviour,[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-mallison2009-66) such as feeding-related activities (contra Rothschild and Molnar).[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-rothschild&molnar-65)\",\n",

Reconstructions of the necks of _Diplodocus_ and _Apatosaurus_ have therefore often portrayed them in near-horizontal, so-called \"neutral, undeflected posture\".[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Steven-71)\\nHowever, research on living animals demonstrates that almost all extant tetrapods hold the base of their necks sharply flexed when alert, showing that any inference from bones about habitual \"neutral postures\"[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Steven-71) is deeply unreliable.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-73) Meanwhile, computer modeling of ostrich necks has raised doubts over the flexibility needed for stationary grazing.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-StiffNeckJournalArticle-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-ScienceDailyStiffNeck-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-NBCStiffNeck-76)',\n",

Ichnites have helped support other biological hypotheses about sauropods, including general fore and hind foot anatomy (see _Limbs and feet_ above). Generally, prints from the forefeet are much smaller than the hind feet, and often crescent-shaped. Occasionally ichnites preserve traces of the claws, and help confirm which sauropod groups lost claws or even digits on their forefeet.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-riga&calvo2009-77)\\nSauropod tracks from the Villar del Arzobispo Formation of early Berriasian age in Spain support the gregarious behaviour of the group. The tracks are possibly more similar to _Sauropodichnus giganteus_ than any other ichnogenera, although they have been suggested to be from a basal titanosauriform. The tracks are wide-gauge, and the grouping as close to _Sauropodichnus_ is also supported by the manus-to-pes distance, the morphology of the manus being kidney bean-shaped, and the morphology of the pes being subtriangular. It cannot be identified whether the footprints of the herd were caused by juveniles or adults, because of the lack of previous trackway individual age identification.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-footprints-78)\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barkhausen_-_Saurierf%C3%A4hrten_-BT-_03.jpg)A sauropod trackway\\nGenerally, sauropod trackways are divided into three categories based on the distance between opposite limbs: narrow gauge, medium gauge, and wide gauge. The gauge of the trackway can help determine how wide-set the limbs of various sauropods were and how this may have impacted the way they walked.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-riga&calvo2009-77) A 2004 study by Day and colleagues found that a general pattern could be found among groups of advanced sauropods, with each sauropod family being characterised by certain trackway gauges. They found that most sauropods other than titanosaurs had narrow-gauge limbs, with strong impressions of the large thumb claw on the forefeet. Medium gauge trackways with claw impressions on the forefeet probably belong to brachiosaurids and other primitive titanosauriformes, which were evolving wider-set limbs but retained their claws. Primitive true titanosaurs also retained their forefoot claw but had evolved fully wide gauge limbs. Wide gauge limbs were retained by advanced titanosaurs, trackways from which show a wide gauge and lack of any claws or digits on the forefeet.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-dayetal2004-79)\\nOccasionally, only trackways from the forefeet are found. Falkingham _et al._[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-80) used computer modelling to show that this could be due to the properties of the substrate. These need to be just right to preserve tracks.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-81) Differences in hind limb and fore limb surface area, and therefore contact pressure with the substrate, may sometimes lead to only the forefeet trackways being preserved.\\n#### Biomechanics and speed\\n[edit]\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argentinosaurus_skeleton,_PLoS_ONE.png)Reconstructed skeleton used to estimate speed, Museo Municipal Carmen Funes, Plaza Huincul, Argentina\\nIn a study published in PLoS ONE on October 30, 2013, by Bill Sellers, Rodolfo Coria, Lee Margetts _et al._ , _Argentinosaurus_ was digitally reconstructed to test its locomotion for the first time. Before the study, the most common way of estimating speed was through studying bone histology and ichnology. Commonly, studies about sauropod bone histology and speed focus on the postcranial skeleton, which holds many unique features, such as an enlarged process on the ulna, a wide lobe on the ilia \"Ilium \\\\(bone\\\\)\"), an inward-slanting top third of the femur, and an extremely ovoid femur shaft. Those features are useful when attempting to explain trackway patterns of graviportal animals. When studying ichnology to calculate sauropod speed, there are a few problems, such as only providing estimates for certain gaits because of preservation bias, and being subject to many more accuracy problems.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-plosone-82)\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PLOS_ONE_Sauropod_locomotion_s010.ogv \"Play video\")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PLOS_ONE_Sauropod_locomotion_s010.ogv)Most likely walking gait of _Argentinosaurus_\\nTo estimate the gait and speed of _Argentinosaurus_ , the study performed a musculoskeletal analysis. The only previous musculoskeletal analyses were conducted on hominoids, terror birds, and other dinosaurs. Before they could conduct the analysis, the team had to create a digital skeleton of the animal in question, show where there would be muscle layering, locate the muscles and joints, and finally find the muscle properties before finding the gait and speed. The results of the biomechanics study revealed that _Argentinosaurus_ was mechanically competent at a top speed of 2 m/s (5 mph) given the great weight of the animal and the strain that its joints were capable of bearing.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-83) The results further revealed that much larger terrestrial vertebrates might be possible, but would require significant body remodeling and possible sufficient behavioral change to prevent joint collapse.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-plosone-82)',\n",
       "  '[edit]\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argentinosaurus_BW.jpg)_Argentinosaurus_ - one of the largest dinosaurs known today\\nSauropods were gigantic descendants of surprisingly small ancestors. Basal dinosauriformes, such as _Pseudolagosuchus_ and _Marasuchus_ from the Middle Triassic of Argentina, weighed approximately 1 kg (2.2 lb) or less. These evolved into saurischia, which saw a rapid increase of bauplan size, although more primitive members like _Eoraptor_ , _Panphagia_ , _Pantydraco_ , _Saturnalia_ and _Guaibasaurus_ still retained a moderate size, possibly under 10 kg (22 lb). Even with these small, primitive forms, there is a notable size increase among sauropodomorphs, although scanty remains of this period make interpretation conjectural. There is one definite example of a small derived sauropodomorph: _Anchisaurus_ , under 50 kg (110 lb), even though it is closer to the sauropods than _Plateosaurus_ and _Riojasaurus_ , which were upwards of 1 t (0.98 long tons; 1.1 short tons) in weight.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50)\\nEvolving from sauropodomorphs, the sauropods were huge. Their giant size probably resulted from an increased growth rate made possible by tachymetabolic endothermy, a trait which evolved in sauropodomorphs. Once branched into sauropods, sauropodomorphs continued steadily to grow larger, with smaller sauropods, like the Early Jurassic _Barapasaurus_ and _Kotasaurus_ , evolving into even larger forms like the Middle Jurassic _Mamenchisaurus_ and _Patagosaurus_. Responding to the growth of sauropods, their theropod predators grew also, as shown by an _Allosaurus_ -sized coelophysoid from Germany.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50)\\n#### Size in Neosauropoda\\n[edit]\\nNeosauropoda is quite plausibly the clade of dinosaurs with the largest body sizes ever to have existed. The few exceptions of smaller size are hypothesized to be caused by island dwarfism, or other ecological pressures, although there is a trend in some Titanosauria towards a smaller size. The titanosaurs, however, were some of the largest sauropods ever. Other than titanosaurs, diplodocoids also reached truly gigantic sizes. Meanwhile, a clade of diplodocoids, called Dicraeosauridae, are identified by a small to medium_[clarification needed_] body size. No sauropods were very small, however, for even \"dwarf\" sauropods are larger than 500 kg (1,100 lb), a size reached by only about 10% of all mammalian species.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50)\\n#### Independent gigantism\\n[edit]\\nAlthough in general, sauropods were large, a gigantic size (40 t (39 long tons; 44 short tons) or more) was reached independently at multiple times in their evolution. Many gigantic forms existed in the Late Jurassic (specifically Kimmeridgian), such as the turiasaur _Turiasaurus_ , the mamenchisaurids _Mamenchisaurus_ and _Xinjiangtitan_ , the diplodocoids _Diplodocus_ , _Apatosaurus_ , _Supersaurus_ and _Barosaurus_ , the camarasaurid _Camarasaurus_ , and the brachiosaurids _Brachiosaurus_ and _Giraffatitan_. Through the Early to Late Cretaceous, the giants _Sauroposeidon_ , _Paralititan_ , _Argentinosaurus_ , _Puertasaurus_ , _Antarctosaurus_ , _Dreadnoughtus_ , _Notocolossus_ , _Futalognkosaurus_ , _Patagotitan_ and _Alamosaurus_ lived, with all possibly being titanosaurs. One sparsely known possible giant is _Huanghetitan ruyangensis_, only known from 3 m (9.8 ft) long ribs. These giant species lived in the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous, appearing independently over a time span of 85 million years.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50)\\n#### Dwarfism in sauropods\\n[edit]\\nMain article: Insular dwarfism\\nTwo well-known island dwarf species of sauropods are the Cretaceous _Magyarosaurus_ (at one point its identity as a dwarf was challenged) and the Jurassic _Europasaurus_ , both from Europe. Even though these sauropods are small, the only way to prove they are true dwarfs is through a study of their bone histology. A study by Martin Sander and colleagues in 2006 examined eleven individuals of _Europasaurus holgeri_ using bone histology and demonstrated that the small island species evolved through a decrease in the growth rate of long bones as compared to rates of growth in ancestral species on the mainland.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-HallHallgr%C3%ADmsson2011-84) Two other possible dwarfs are _Rapetosaurus_ , which existed on the island of Madagascar, an isolated island in the Cretaceous, and _Ampelosaurus_ , a titanosaur that lived on the Iberian peninsula of southern Spain and France. _Amanzia_ from Switzerland might also be a dwarf, but this has yet to be proven.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50) One of the most extreme cases of island dwarfism is found in _Europasaurus_ , a relative of the much larger _Camarasaurus_ and _Brachiosaurus_ : it was only about 6.2 m (20 ft) long, an identifying trait of the species. As for all dwarf species, their reduced growth rate led to their small size.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-P-31)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50) Another taxon of tiny sauropods, the saltasaurid titanosaur _Ibirania_ , 5.7 metres (19 feet) long, lived a non-insular context in Upper Creaceous Brazil, and is an example of nanism resultant from other ecological pressures.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-85)',\n",

Owen thought at the time that _Cetiosaurus_ was a giant marine reptile related to modern crocodiles, hence its name, which means \"whale lizard\". A year later, when Owen coined the name Dinosauria, he did not include _Cetiosaurus_ and _Cardiodon_ in that group.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-owen1842-98)\\nIn 1850, Gideon Mantell recognized the dinosaurian nature of several bones assigned to _Cetiosaurus_ by Owen. Mantell noticed that the leg bones contained a medullary cavity, a characteristic of land animals. He assigned these specimens to the new genus _Pelorosaurus_ , and grouped it together with the dinosaurs. However, Mantell still did not recognize the relationship to _Cetiosaurus_.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2008-46)\\nThe next sauropod find to be described and misidentified as something other than a dinosaur were a set of hip vertebrae described by Harry Seeley in 1870. Seeley found that the vertebrae were very lightly constructed for their size and contained openings for air sacs (_pneumatization_). Such air sacs were at the time known only in birds and pterosaurs, and Seeley considered the vertebrae to come from a pterosaur. He named the new genus _Ornithopsis_ , or \"bird face\" because of this.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2008-46)\\nWhen more complete specimens of _Cetiosaurus_ were described by Phillips in 1871, he finally recognized the animal as a dinosaur related to _Pelorosaurus_.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-phillips1871-99) However, it was not until the description of new, nearly complete sauropod skeletons from the United States (representing _Apatosaurus_ and _Camarasaurus_) later that year that a complete picture of sauropods emerged. An approximate reconstruction of a complete sauropod skeleton was produced by artist John A. Ryder, hired by paleontologist E.D. Cope, based on the remains of _Camarasaurus_ , though many features were still inaccurate or incomplete according to later finds and biomechanical studies.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-osbornmook1921-100) Also in 1877, Richard Lydekker named another relative of _Cetiosaurus_ , _Titanosaurus_ , based on an isolated vertebra.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-taylor2008-46)\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Macronaria_scrubbed_enh.jpg)Several macronarian sauropods; from left to right, _Camarasaurus_ , _Brachiosaurus_ , _Giraffatitan_ , and _Euhelopus_.\\nIn 1878, the most complete sauropod yet was found and described by Othniel Charles Marsh, who named it _Diplodocus_.

They defined the clade as a node-based taxon, containing \"the most recent common ancestor of _Vulcanodon karibaensis_ and Eusauropoda and all of its descendants\".[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Salgado1997-101) Later, several stem-based definitions were proposed, including one by Yates (2007), who defined Sauropoda as \"the most inclusive clade that includes _Saltasaurus loricatus_ but not _Melanorosaurus readi_ \".[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Fabr%C3%A8gues2015-102)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-103)\\nProponents of this definition also use the clade name **Gravisauria** , defined as the most recent ancestor of _Tazoudasaurus naimi_ and _Saltasaurus loricatus_ and all of its descendants[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Allain2008-104) for the clade equivalent to Sauropoda as defined by Salgado _et al._[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-Pol2021-105) The clade Gravisauria was appointed by the French paleontologist Ronan Allain and Moroccan paleontologist Najat Aquesbi in 2008 when a cladistic analysis of the dinosaur found by Allain, _Tazoudasaurus_ , as the outcome was that the family \"Family \\\\(biology\\\\)\") Vulcanodontidae. The group includes _Tazoudasaurus_ and _Vulcanodon_ , and the sister taxon Eusauropoda, but also certain species such as _Antetonitrus_ , _Gongxianosaurus_ and _Isanosaurus_ that do not belong in Vulcanodontidae but to an even more basic position occupied in Sauropoda. It made sense to have Sauropoda compared to this, more derived group that included Vulcanodontidae and Eusauropoda in a definition: defined as the group formed by the last common ancestor of _Tazoudasaurus_ and _Saltasaurus_ (Bonaparte and Powell, 1980) and all its descendants. Aquesbi mentioned two synapomorphies, shared derived characteristics of Gravisauria: the vertebrae are wider side to side than front to rear and possession of asymmetrical condyles femoris at the bottom of the femur. Those were previously not thought to be Eusauropoda synapomorphies but Allian found these properties also on _Tazoudasaurus_.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-allian,_2008-106)\\nGravisauria split off in the Early Jurassic, around the Pliensbachian and Toarcian, 183 million years ago, and Aquesbi thought that this was part of a much larger revolution in the fauna, which includes the disappearance of Prosauropoda, Coelophysoidea and basal \"Basal \\\\(phylogenetics\\\\)\") Thyreophora, which they attributed to a worldwide mass extinction.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-allian,_2008-106)\\nThe phylogenetic relationships of the sauropods have largely stabilised in recent years, though there are still some uncertainties, such as the placement of _Euhelopus_ , _Haplocanthosaurus_ , _Jobaria_ and Nemegtosauridae.\\nCladogram after an analysis presented by Sander and colleagues in 2011.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda#cite_note-sander2011-50)\\n**†Sauropoda** |  |  |  _†Antetonitrus_\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Vulcanodon_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vulcanodon_NT.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Spinophorosaurus_\\n---|---\\n†Eusauropoda |  |  |  _†Shunosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shunosaurus_life_restoration.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Barapasaurus_[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barapasaurus_DB.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Patagosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Patagosaurus.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  | †Mamenchisauridae |  |  |  _†Mamenchisaurus_\\n---|---\\n|  _†Omeisaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Omeisaurus_tianfuensis34.jpg)\\n|  |  |  _†Cetiosaurus_\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Jobaria_\\n---|---\\n†Neosauropoda |  |  |  _†Haplocanthosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haplocanthosaurus.jpg)\\n---|---\\n†Diplodocoidea |  | †Rebbachisauridae |  |  |  _†Limaysaurus_\\n---|---\\n|  _†Nigersaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nigersaurus_BW.jpg)\\n|  | †Dicraeosauridae |  |  |  _†Amargasaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amargasaurus_NT_small_\\\\(mirrored\\\\).jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  _†Dicraeosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dicraeosaurus_hansemanni22_flipped.jpg)\\n†Diplodocidae |  |  |  _†Apatosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apatosaurus_louisae_by_durbed_flipped.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Barosaurus_\\n---|---\\n|  _†Diplodocus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diplodocus_carnegii_flipped.jpg)\\n†Macronaria |  |  |  _†Camarasaurus_\\n---|---\\n†Titanosauriformes |  |  |  _†Brachiosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brachiosaurus_DB_flipped.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Phuwiangosaurus_\\n---|---\\n†Titanosauria |  |  |  _†Malawisaurus_\\n---|---\\n†Saltasauridae |  |  |  _†Rapetosaurus_ [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rapetosaurus_BW.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  _†Isisaurus_\\n---|---\\n|  |  |  |  _†Opisthocoelicaudia_ |  [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Opisthocoelicaudia_flipped.jpg)\\n---|---\\n|  |  _†Saltasaurus_ |  [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saltasaurus_dinosaur.png)\\n---|---',\n",

Apparently no post mortem hydraulic transportation had taken place before burial.',\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking what food sauropods ate. Let me check the provided information. The context mentions that sauropods were herbivorous, eating plants like conifers, seed ferns, and angiosperms. There's also a mention of possible supplementary diet with small animals, especially during breeding seasons. But the key point here is the direct evidence from the Diamantinasaurus cololite, which shows they ate plants. The answer should focus on the primary diet as plants, with the supplementary info being secondary. Need to make sure to highlight the herbivory based on the gut contents found. Also, the user wants a concise answer without mentioning any sources or documents. So, the answer should state they primarily ate plants, specifically conifers, seed ferns, and angiosperms, and maybe mention the possible small animals as additional info but not the main point.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hmm, in the context, there's not a direct mention of their diet, but it does talk about them being herbivores. Wait, actually, looking through the content again—there's no explicit statement saying \"herbivore.\" But I remember from general knowledge that sauropods were large plant-eaters. The user might be assuming they ate plants since they're so big with long necks, but maybe they want confirmation or more specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context does mention their physical characteristics like small heads and pillar-like legs, which are adaptations for a herbivorous diet. Also, the fossils being found worldwide suggests they were widespread, possibly eating common vegetation. The user might not just want \"plants\" as an answer but could be curious about why that's the case or if there are exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the context, some sections talk about bone histology and other studies, but nothing directly on diet. However, the article does state they were sauropods which are saurischian dinosaurs, typically herbivores. The user might need more than just a yes; maybe examples of plants or how their feeding mechanism worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the answer in the context says \"Answer: Herbivores\" so that's straightforward. Maybe the user is looking for a quick fact but also wants to understand if there's any uncertainty. Should I mention possible debates, like whether all sauropods were strict herbivores? The provided context doesn't go into that detail though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering the structure of the answer—maybe they want it concise because the thought process should be brief too. They might not have a deep need for complex details but just a basic understanding. However, since they asked about food specifically, maybe they're interested in how their feeding contributed to their size or extinction patterns. But without more info from the context, sticking with herbivores and plant-based diet seems safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another angle: could there be any carnivorous sauropods? The thought process should note that while some sources might question it, based on general knowledge, they were herbivores. But since the provided context doesn't mention exceptions, maybe just state herbivore without complicating it further unless necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check if the user wants specifics like types of plants (gymnosperms vs angiosperms). The answer here is more general—herbivores and plant-based diet. Maybe they're a student needing a simple answer for an assignment, so keeping it concise is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, even without explicit details in the context about their specific diet beyond being herbivores, the presence of long necks and large size implies they ate plants. The thought process should connect these traits to infer their diet, while the answer directly states herbivore based on typical sauropod characteristics.\n",
