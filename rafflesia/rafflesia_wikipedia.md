See Classification section   
_**Rafflesia**_ (/rəˈfliːz(i)ə,ˈfliːʒ(i)ə,ræ-/),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-2) or **stinking corpse lily** ,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-McNeely-3) is a genus of parasitic flowering plants in the family Rafflesiaceae.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-POWO-4) The species have enormous flowers, the buds rising from the ground or directly from the lower stems of their host plants; one species has the largest flower in the world. Plants of the World Online lists up to 41 species from this genus;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-POWO-4) all of them are found throughout Southeast Asia. 
Western Europeans first learned about plants of this genus from French surgeon and naturalist Louis Deschamps when he was in Java between 1791 and 1794; but his notes and illustrations were seized by the British in 1798 and were not available to Western scientists until 1861.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Meijer1997-5) The first British person to see one was Joseph Arnold in 1818, in the Indonesia rainforest in Bengkulu, Sumatra, after a Malay servant working for him discovered a flower and pointed it out to him.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Keng1978-6) The flower, and the genus, was later named after Stamford Raffles,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-7) the leader of the expedition and the founder of the British colony of Singapore. 
The following is from Arnold's account of discovering the flower:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Keng1978-6)
> Here I rejoice to tell you I happened to meet with what I consider as the greatest prodigy of the vegetable world. I had ventured some way from the party, when one of the Malay servants came running to me ... To tell you the truth, had I been alone, and had there been no witnesses, I should, I think, have been fearful of mentioning the dimensions of this flower, so much does it exceed every flower I have seen or heard of.
Vivid contemporary accounts documenting some of the most inaccessible species of Rafflesia are described in the popular science book, _Pathless Forest: The Quest to Save the World's Largest Flowers_, by botanist Chris Thorogood based at the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. 
## Description
[edit]
[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Preserved_Rafflesia_displayed_in_Philippine_National_Museum.jpg)Replica of _Rafflesia_ flower displayed in National Museum of Natural History "National Museum of Natural History \(Manila\)") in Manila.
The plant has no stems, leaves or roots. It is a holoparasite of vines in the genus _Tetrastigma_ (a plant in the Vitaceae, the grape vine family), spreading its absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Harvard-8) The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petalled flower. In some species, such as _Rafflesia arnoldii_ , the flower may be over 100 centimetres (40 in) in diameter, and weigh up to 10 kilograms (22 lb). A _Rafflesia_ that flowered in West Sumatra in 2019 was measured to be almost 4 feet (120 cm) in diameter, the largest flower ever recorded – 4 inches (10 cm) wider than the flower reported as the largest in 2017.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-CNN-9) Even one of the smallest species, _R. baletei_ , has 12 cm (5 in) diameter flowers._[citation needed_] A team of morphologists and geneticists headed by Prof. Charles Davis of Harvard has discovered an important difference between _Rafflesia_ spp. and the very similar _Sapria_ spp. In both genera the petals are now described as sepals (or more correctly as "petaloid tepals") instead of vaguely defined "perigon lobes". In _Sapria_ , the "diaphragm" is a true corona "Corona \(perianth\)") while in _Rafflesia_ the diaphragm is made up of adnate petals to form a dome, the true corona being greatly reduced.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-10)
The flowers look and smell like rotting flesh. The foul odour attracts insects such as carrion flies, which transport pollen from male to female flowers. Most species are dioecious, having separate male and female flowers, but a few (_R. baletei_ and _R. verrucosa_) have hermaphroditic flowers.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-11) Little is known about seed dispersal. Tree shrews and other forest mammals eat the fruits.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-OriginalKew-12) The extremely tiny seeds have extremely tiny elaiosomes, and are thus most likely dispersed by ants. The seeds are packed into berries, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of seeds.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Harvard-8)
Because _Amorphophallus_ has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world's largest flower. Both _Rafflesia_ and _Amorphophallus_ are flowering plants, but they are unrelated to each other. _Rafflesia arnoldii_ has the largest _single_ flower of any flowering plant, at least in terms of weight. _Amorphophallus titanum_ has the largest _unbranched_ inflorescence, while the talipot palm (_Corypha umbraculifera_) forms the largest _branched_ inflorescence, containing thousands of flowers; the talipot is monocarpic, meaning the individual plants die after flowering._[citation needed_]
'Rafflesia _are also remarkable for showing a large[horizontal transfer of genes from their host plants. This is well known among bacteria, but not higher organisms. It occurs in the mitochondria (originally derived from bacteria) found within the cells of _Rafflesia _; these appear to have exchanged genes with the mitochondria of the host tissue.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Harvard-8)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Molina2014-13)_
## Names
[edit]
[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bunga_Rafflesia_Di_Akar_Gantung.jpg)_Rafflesia_ on hanging roots. West Sumatra, Indonesia.
In Indonesian and Malaysian, it is known as _padma_. The species _R. arnoldii_ is known as _padma raksasa_ ("giant _padma_ ").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-kamus-14) In Javanese it is called _patma_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Burkill1930-15) In Malay, the 'normal' _R. hasseltii_ is vernacularly known as _pakma_ , _patma_ or _ambai-ambai_ ,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Keng1978-6)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Burkill1930-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-sealang-16) whereas the goliath _R. arnoldii_ from Sumatra is called _krubut_ or _kerubut_ , 'great flower'.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Keng1978-6)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-sealang-16) The words _padma_ , _pakma_ or _patma_ originate etymologically from the word पद्म (_padma_), Sanskrit for 'lotus'.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-sealang-16)
In English _Rafflesia_ is known as the stinking corpse lily.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-McNeely-3) It is also known as "corpse flower", or _bunga bangkai_ in Indonesian,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-17) a name that more commonly refers to the titan arum (_Amorphophallus titanum_) of the family Araceae.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-18)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Harvard-8) The type species _arnoldii_ has been called the "monster flower".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-19)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-CNN-9)
## Taxonomy
[edit]
Robert Brown "Robert Brown \(Scottish botanist from Montrose\)") introduced the genus _Rafflesia_ to the wider scientific world in a presentation before the Linnean Society of London in June 1820, but his scientific paper on the subject was only published in late 1821.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-ipni-1)
In 1999 the British botanical historian David Mabberley pointed out that the genus _Rafflesia_ was first validated by an anonymous report on the meeting published in the _Annals of Philosophy_ in September 1820 (the name was technically an unpublished _nomen nudum_ until this publication). Mabberley claimed the author was Samuel Frederick Gray.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Mabberley1999-20) However, as that is nowhere stated in the _Annals_ , per Article 46.8 of the code of ICBN, Mabberley was wrong to formally ascribe the validation to Gray. The validation of the name was thus attributed to one Thomas Thomson, the editor of the _Annals_ in 1820, by the IPNI. Mabberley admitted his error in 2017.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-ipni-1) This Thomson was not the botanist Thomas Thomson "Thomas Thomson \(botanist\)"), who was three years old in 1820, but his identically named father "Thomas Thomson \(chemist\)"), a chemist.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-ipni3-21)
## Evolution and phylogeny

Comparison of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of _Rafflesia_ with other angiosperm mtDNA indicated this parasite evolved from photosynthetic plants of the order Malpighiales.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-22) Another 2004 study confirmed this result using both mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences, and showed the three other groups traditionally classified in Rafflesiaceae were unrelated.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-23) A 2007 study more specifically found _Rafflesia_ and its relatives to be embedded within the family Euphorbiaceae as traditionally circumscribed "Circumscription \(taxonomy\)"), which was surprising, as members of that family typically have very small flowers. According to their analysis, the rate of flower size evolution was more or less constant throughout the family except at the origin of Rafflesiaceae, where the flowers rapidly evolved to become much larger before reverting to the slower rate of change.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-DaviLatvNickWurd07-24)
To maintain monophyletic families, in 2016 the APG IV system separated the family Peraceae from the Euphorbiaceae.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-APGIV-25) A summary cladogram is shown below,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-DaviLatvNickWurd07-24) with family placements in the APG IV system.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-APGIV-25)

A 2010 molecular phylogenetic study of 18 species of _Rafflesia_ found that they fell into four clear-cut geographically defined groups:[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-BendSchuGussNais10-26)

However, the clear monophyly of the four geographical clades does not correspond to any clear difference in appearance. There is no consistency within the clades in the size of flowers, or the presence or absence of white warts; species in different clades resemble one another more than they do some other species within the same clade. Homoplasy – repeatedly gaining or losing traits – seems to be the rule within _Rafflesia_.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-BendSchuGussNais10-26)

### Other names
[edit]
  * _Rafflesia patma_ – Java; considered a synonym "Synonym \(taxonomy\)") of _R. horsfieldii_ by Plants of the World Online,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-POWO_77089854-1-27) apparently based on the confused writings of a British historian of botany,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Mabberley1999-20) although _R. horsfieldii_ , for which no specimens were ever collected, only a drawing made which was lost centuries ago, is not considered a valid taxon by _Rafflesia_ experts.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Meijer1988-30)
  * _Rafflesia titan_ – A synonym of _R. arnoldii_ ; it was in fact validly published earlier, being rushed to publication in Singapore in 1820 by a British botanist who feared that the French, who had actually discovered a species before the British, might deny the glory of the species description to servants of the British Empire.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Meijer1997-5) In order to retain the honour of naming the species to the famous British scientist Robert Brown, the historian of botany mentioned above chose to pretend a 1821 pre-print Brown sent to a colleague was a valid 'effective publication',[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Mabberley1999-20) which has been accepted by the relevant British institutions.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-POWO_77089854-1-27)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-ipni4-31)


### Loss of the chloroplast genome
[edit]
Research published in 2014 revealed that one Philippine _Rafflesia_ species from the island of Luzon, _R. lagascae_ (a synonym of _R. manillana_), may have lost the genome of its chloroplast and it is speculated that the loss happened due to the parasitic lifestyle of the plant.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Molina2014-13)
## Distribution
[edit]
### Malay Peninsula
[edit]
Rafflesia can be found along the area of Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand in the Malay Peninsula.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPerak-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaThai-33)
#### Malaysia
[edit]
In Peninsular Malaysia, the flower can be found in few states, such as Kelantan, Pahang, Perak and Terengganu. In Perak, three species of the flower can be found in Royal Belum state park and Gerik forest reserve of which are _Rafflesia kerrii_ , _Rafflesia cantleyi_ and _Rafflesia azlanii_. _Rafflesia azlanii_ was named after the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPerak-32) Meanwhile, two species of the flower hosted by _Tetrastigma Planch_ can be found in three location in Kelantan. The _Rafflesia cantleyi_ species can be found in Ulut Sat and Chabang Tongkat while _Rafflesia kerrii_ can be found in Lojing.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaKelantan-34) Furthermore, two locations in Pahang where this flower can be found are Lembah Benum forest reserve and Lata Jarum.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPahangBenum-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPahangLJ-36) For Terengganu, the flower of _Rafflesia Cantleyi_ species can be found in Kuala Berang. A flower has been found in this area hanging on the root of its host three metres above the ground, unlike the common flowers found on the ground roots.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-HangingRafflesia-37)
The locations of these flowers are turned into tourist attractions for biodiversity lovers and hikers and helps to generate income for the local people.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaKelantan-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPahangBenum-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaPahangLJ-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-HangingRafflesia-37)
#### Thailand
[edit]
In Thailand _Rafflesia_ can be observed in Khao Sok National Park where the flowers are numbered and monitored by the park rangers.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-RafflesiaThai-33)
### Greater Sunda Islands
[edit]
Species native to Borneo include _Rafflesia arnoldii_ , _R. cantleyi_ , _R. hasseltii_ , _R. keithii_ , _R. kerrii_ , _R. pricei_, _R. tengku-adlinii_ and _R. tuan-mudae_. _R. arnoldii_ boasts the world's largest single bloom.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-38)
_R. keithii_ is an endemic species in Sabah and the largest among the three species of Rafflesia found in Sabah. The flower size is between 60 cm to 80 cm. Due to its size, the flower is generally found on the forest floor growing on the underground stem or root of _Tetrastigma lanceolarium_. _R. keithii_ can be mostly found around the area of Poring, Sabah.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-40)
### Mindanao species
[edit]
The Mindanao species is known as _Rafflesia schadenbergiana_ , after the naturalist Alexander Schadenberg, who first discovered the species at the foothills of Mount Apo in 1882. With a flower of nearly a meter, it is close to the size of a seated child. On Mindanao, the species has been seen in Davao del Sur, South Cotabato and Mount Kitanglad in Bukidnon.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-41) _R. mira_ and _R. magnifica_ are two names for a single species. Both were discovered at Mount Candalaga in Maragusan, Compostela Valley. The two forms differ in size measurements in which the scientific description of _R. magnifica_ came from measurements of flowers in full bloom while that of _R. mira_ was from photographs of nearly dead samples. The medium-sized _R. mira_ flowers measure about half a meter in diameter and they have round or elliptic perigone wart.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-medulid-42) The third species on Mindanao is the _R. mixta_ which has only been found so far in the town of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. It shows a combination of three features of Philippine _Rafflesia_ , namely: the shape and size of the conical process in _R. schadenbergiana_ , the floral size and sparsely distributed perigone warts of _R. speciosa_ , and the overall resemblance, floral size, faint scent, diaphragm and ramenta morphology of _R. mira_.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-43) A fourth species is _Rafflesia verrucosa_ which is found only in Mount Kampalili in Davao Oriental Province.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-44)
## Ecology
[edit]
[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rafflesia_arnoldii_cycle.jpg)_Rafflesia arnoldii_ life cycle.
Species of _Rafflesia_ are all thought to be holoparasites of lianas of the genus _Tetrastigma_ , vines which belong to the Vitaceae, the family of the grape vines. They are thus, in a way, hyperparasites, because _Tetrastigma_ are themselves, in a way, structural parasites of the trees they use to climb up to the light. _Rafflesia_ appear to be species-specific, with each _Rafflesia_ species naturally only growing on one to three species of _Tetrastigma_. Of the 57 known species of _Tetrastigma_ , only ten are known to be host plants. Of the 30 odd species of _Rafflesia_ , the host plants are only known from about half of the species. A certain species of _Tetrastigma_ is very popular among _Rafflesia_ : _T. tuberculatum_ is a host plant for at least 15 species, and only two Philippine species are not known to infect it. _T. papillosum_ and _T. diepenhorstii_ both host at least two species. The flowers may bud from different locations; _R. cantleyi_ flowers from the vine some two meters from the ground, [[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Susatya2011-45) whereas _R. zollingeriana_ always buds out of the roots and appears out of the ground.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Maezulpah2019-46)
The gender ratio may be skewed. In _R. lobata_ there are approximately nine male flowers for every female flower.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Lestari2014-47) Rarely are there flowers of both sexes at one location to ensure pollination and thus sexual reproduction. This may not matter: female flowers usually form fruit anyway and may thus be agamospermous.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Susatya2011-45) Flowering is relatively constant, and sites may continue to flower for decades.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Damayanti2014-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Barcelona-49)
In _Rafflesia arnoldii_ the flowers are visited by the flies _Drosophila colorata_ , _Chrysomya megacephala_ and _Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis_. Black ants of the genus _Euprenolepis_ may feed on the developing flower buds, perhaps killing them.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Pranata2019-50) Mammals which are known to eat the flowers are the Javan treeshrew _Tupaia javanica_ and the porcupine _Hystrix javanica_. Mammals which have been recorded destroying the buds or flowers, often simply by stepping on and crushing them, are: pigs (_Sus scrofa_), wild cats (_Prionailurus bengalensis_), rusa (_Cervus timorensis_), muntjak (_Muntiacus muntjak_) and banteng (_Bos javanicus_).[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Susatya2011-45)
## Uses
[edit]
In Thailand the buds and flowers of _R. kerrii_ are considered a delicacy. They are also harvested for herbalism, a concoction is believed to act as a sexual stimulant and to help for fever or backache.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-51) In the Philippines the plants are also used in folk herbalism, but the flowers are also fed to swine as fodder.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Barcelona-49) On Java the buds of _R. zollingeriana_ are harvested and dried for use in _jamu_ , the ancient traditional herbalism of the island. It is unknown for what the buds are supposed to be good for;[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Damayanti2014-48) _jamu_ concoctions are often complex mixtures and often are supposed to help with sexual prowess._[citation needed_]
These plants also have some economic use in attracting ecotourists.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-52)
Research in Malaysia and Indonesia has made it possible to propagate the species for use in horticulture, with the famous Bogor Botanical Garden growing the first plants in the 1850s using grafts of infected vines. The Malaysian biologist Jamili Nais was the first to propagate the plants using the seeds around the year 2000.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia#cite_note-Susatya2011-45)
