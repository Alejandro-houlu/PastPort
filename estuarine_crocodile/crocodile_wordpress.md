## Crocodile Stitch – Increases – Photo Tutorial
I’m not really sure what to call this, but it’s for the most common shape for a shawl, point down triangle, upside down triangle, increase stitches…? It is worked flat, starting with one scale, then building from there.
Anyhow, this is how I do it.
**Stitches used are in US terminology**
_**Note:** I am right handed, for left handed stitchers, the photos would be in reverse._
**Terms used with abbreviations:**
ch – chain  
dc – double crochet  
slst -slip stitch  
st(s) – stitch(es)

Hi there. Hmmmm… Thinking about it, if you’re talking about a flat round blanket in the dragon scale stitch, I’m not sure if it would work considering the nature of the stitch. It does work wonderfully for the in the round tube-style mermaid blankets that are popular right now
On the other hand, there is a flower pattern using a modified version of the stitch. It’s a Hydrangea flower, but the scales/petals do not lay flat, they will curl up.
It seems that this pattern might work for what you’re looking for because she works the foundations and the scales separately, so the points of the scales point toward to outside of the blanket. She has a video of how she does it. You might want to ask her about having it modified into a blanket. Her patterns are copyrighted with ‘All Rights Reserved’, so I couldn’t, in good conscious, modify it for someone else without her permission.

The way I’ve done decreasing on the crocodile stitch is when I reach the end of a scale row where I want to start the decreasing, slip stitch to the center of the scale of the previous row, ch3 (1st decrease), then continue the base row as usual to the 2nd to the last scale of the previous row, dc into the center of the last scale (2nd decrease). Work the scale row a usual. This is to decrease evenly on both sides. If you only want to decrease on 1 side at a time, depending on what side you want to decrease, do either the 1st or 2nd decrease, then work the rest as usual.
