## Highlights
•
Gut contents were found in a specimen of the Australian sauropod _Diamantinasaurus_
•
Gut contents support herbivory, bulk feeding, and multi-level browsing in sauropods
•
Plants eaten by _Diamantinasaurus_ include conifers, seed ferns, and angiosperms
•
Mineralization of gut contents and skin attests to unusual preservational conditions
## Summary
Sauropod dinosaurs were abundant and diverse across much of the globe throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and include the largest terrestrial animals of all time. Since the discovery of the first near-complete skeletons in the late 19th century, sauropods have been almost universally interpreted as herbivorous. However, our concept of their diet is based on indirect evidence and inference since no sauropod fossilized gut contents (cololites) are known. Here, we describe a cololite associated with a specimen of the sauropod _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ from the mid-Cretaceous (∼101–94 Ma) Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia. The cololite is hosted within an indurated rock layer, localized to the abdominal region, and closely and consistently associated with a layer of mineralized skin. Conifer pinnules, angiosperm leaves, and seed-fern fruiting bodies are preserved within, as are chemical biomarkers consistent with gymnosperms and angiosperms. This _Diamantinasaurus_ cololite provides the first direct, empirical evidence in sauropods of herbivory, demonstrating generalist feeding, low- to high-level browsing, and minimal oral processing of food. The longevity of the clade Sauropoda was underpinned by the persistence through time of generalist feeders like _Diamantinasaurus_ that were capable of feeding at a range of heights on a variety of different plant species.

A′) Site map of the _Diamantinasaurus_ site (AODL 0246), showing the position of the various skeletal elements and the gut contents excavated between 29/05–18/06/2017 and 14–27/08/2017.
(B) Photograph of the northwestern section of the gut contents _in situ_ on 10/06/2017 (extracted before 16/06/2017, hence their absence in A). Anatomical acronyms: as, astragalus; co, coracoid; cr, cervical rib; cv, cervical vertebra; dr, dorsal rib; dv, dorsal vertebra; fe, femur; fi, fibula; hu, humerus; il, ilium; L, left; lg, unidentified limb or girdle element; M, megaraptorid; pu, pubis; R, right; sa, sacrum; sc, scapula; sp, sternal plate; t, tooth; ti, tibia; ul, ulna. Roman numerals indicate serial positions of vertebrae, ribs, and metapodials.

Figure 2 _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ (AODF 0888) gut contents and mineralized skin
Show full caption
(A) Photograph of the upper surface of a southeast section of the indurated layer, showing the gut contents with fossilized conifer and angiosperm foliage and encrustations of gypsum (white).
(B) Photograph of the lower surface of the same, showing rare plants in the matrix underlying the skin layer, as well as partially exposed skin (bottom right; see Figure 300550-0#fig3)).
(C) Photograph of the upper surface of the northwest section of the indurated layer, showing the gut contents layer with encrustations of gypsum (gray-white). Neutron tomography scans of some sections (left) are shown to demonstrate the distribution of plant fossils in the lower gut contents layer of each (letters in parentheses correspond to the cross sections below). Plant fragments longer than 100 mm are rare, and all seem to have been severed.
(D and D′) Photograph of the lower surface of the northwest section of the indurated layer, showing rare plants in the matrix underlying the skin layer, as well as partially exposed and fully exposed skin.
(E) Photograph of a cross section through a section of gut contents, showing three distinct layers: the lower gut contents (lg), wherein there are numerous plant fossils preserved as molds/voids; the diagenetic layer (dl), wherein plant remains are rare and colloform iron hydroxide (goethite) is dominant; and the upper gut contents (ug), which preserves fewer plant remains.
(F) Neutron tomography scan of a section of gut contents, showing the same layers as the specimen above, but with mineralized skin (sk) evident below the lower gut contents layer.
(G) Neutron tomography scan of a section of gut contents, showing a discontinuous diagenetic layer between the upper and lower gut contents layers, with mineralized skin (sk) and orange matrix (om) layers.
See also Figures S300550-0#mmc1)–S600550-0#mmc1).

Figure 3 _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ (AODF 0888) indurated layer southeast section and unusual skin preservation away from the indurated layer
Show full caption
(A and A′) Photograph of the lower surface of a portion of the southeast section of the indurated layer, showing four discrete layers: from stratigraphically lowest to highest, these are matrix obscuring scaly skin, the skin layer itself, a deeper layer of the integument that is pustulate but lacks clear scale impressions, and an angiosperm leaf, preserved within the lower gut contents layer that has been exposed where the deeper layer of the integument has been lost.
(B) Photograph of the upper surface of a portion of the southeast section of the indurated layer, showing angiosperm and conifer leaves along with other indeterminate (and often incompletely exposed) plant fragments.
(C) Close up of (A), revealing the skin, the deeper layer of the integument, and the angiosperm in the lower gut contents layer.
(D) Mineralized skin in siltstone, showing papillae.
(E) Mineralized skin showing clear polygonal scales with papillae. Scale bar for (A)–(C) 50 mm, for (D) and (E) 10 mm. See also Figures S300550-0#mmc1)–S600550-0#mmc1).

Figure 4 _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ (AODF 0888) cololite _μ_ CT scan data showing plant fossils within
Show full caption
(A) Cross section through indurated layer sample AODF 0888.A showing the clear delineation between the lower gut contents and the diagenetic layer above. Skin was not preserved in this specimen.
(B and B′) view of three parallel bracts, probably referable to _Austrosequoia wintonensis_ , within the lower gut contents layer.
(C) Cross section through cololite sample, showing the lower gut contents and diagenetic layers, with a conifer bract and other plant fossils in the diagenetic layer exposed in different orientations.
(D and D′) cf. _Austrosequoia wintonensis_ bract fragments (see also Figure S600550-0#mmc1)B).
(E) Cross section through cololite sample, showing the lower gut contents and diagenetic layers, with a conifer bract and other plant fossils in the diagenetic layer exposed in different orientations, with a cross section through the bent stem depicted in (F) and (F′).
(F and F′) Bent and possibly cropped stem fragment (see also Figure S600550-0#mmc1)F), along with other plant fragments within the cololite.
(G and G′) Cross section through cololite sample, showing the variable density of plant fossils within the lower gut contents layer (denser) and the overlying diagenetic layer (sparser). Photographs labeled without an apostrophe show a single 22-μm-thick slice through the data, whereas those with an apostrophe (′) represent collages of slices showing the minimum intensity (darkest areas = molds/voids) of the studied section. All are from the sample AODF 0888.A. Scale bar, 10 mm.

Figure 5 _Diamantinasaurus matildae_ (AODF 0888) cololite thin section and organic geochemical analyses
Show full caption
(A) Light microscope image (transmitted light) of the thin section through a section of the indurated layer (AODF 0888.B).
(B) _μ_ CT slice of AODF 0888.B at the position of the thin section, showing vertisol infilling of some molds/voids.
(C) TIMA map of the abundance of iron oxide in the sample, with more intense red reflecting a higher percentage.
(D) Ratio of regular (reg) steranes + diasteranes (dia) to total steranes in different bitumen fractions of each sample reflecting low alkalinity for the skin, true gut contents, and diagenetic layers relative to the matrix surrounding dorsal vertebra VIII.
(E) Plant biomarkers identified and quantified in aromatic fractions of samples.
(F) Primary mineral phases of AODF 0888.B identified via TIMA analysis, with those identified ordered from most abundant to least abundant in the key. Minerals with abundances <0.2 of the sample were grouped together. Grain size of the sample varies (coarser upward).
(G) Section of GC×GC-TOFMS extracted ion chromatograms (_m_ /_z_ 191) of an authentic lupane standard (top) and an extract from the cololite (bottom), with retention times and mass spectra consistent with the angiosperm-specific biomarker lupane.5200550-0#bib52)
