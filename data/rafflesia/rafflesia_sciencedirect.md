## Abstract
We report the floral scent composition of the endophytic holoparasite _Rafflesia consueloae_ for the first time. Using a non-destructive _in situ_ method that we developed, we identified 13 volatile compounds present in the scent of _R. consuelaoe._ Among the compounds detected were several benzenoids, organosilicons, an oligosulfide, a monoterpenoid, and a fatty acid-derived compound. Comparing the scent profiles of different reproductive stages, we found that all stages produced a similar set of volatiles, except for the flowers in bloom. The sulfur-containing dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which is mainly responsible for the rotten smell of the flower, was only detected in the scent of full-bloom flowers indicating that its synthesis only takes place when the aperture is fully open and the flies are able to access the sex organs. Moreover, an analysis of the scent components of different floral parts from full-bloom flowers revealed that the different floral structures had varying scent profiles. The diaphragm and chamber floor produced the most volatiles. Notably, DMDS was only detected from the diaphragm and the central disk. Emission of putrid-smelling volatiles in these tissues may lure the flies into entering the floral chamber where the reproductive structures are located, thus increasing pollination success. Overall, this pioneering study of the _R. consueloae_ floral scent composition provides valuable insights into the pollination mechanisms of the enigmatic _Rafflesia_ genus and parasitic floral ecology in general.
## Introduction
Amongst parasitic angiosperms, _Rafflesia_ R. Br. (Rafflesiaceae) garners the most attention due to its enigmatic biology. It is one of the eight genera of endoparasitic plants that deviate from other plant parasites in terms of development as they do not go through vegetative growth to form a functioning photosynthetic body (Thorogood et al. 2021). Instead, the vegetative body of _Rafflesia_ mostly consists of mycelium-like strands of undifferentiated cells, known as the endophyte, which can grow for prolonged periods inside its _Tetrastigma_ vine hosts (Nikolov et al. 2014, Bascos et al. 2021). _Rafflesia_ does not form roots, stems, or leaves, and only emerges from the host's root or stem during flowering. The extreme parasitism of _Rafflesia_ eliminates the need to form a photosynthetic stage and allows for allocation of host resources solely for reproductive development, resulting in the production of exceptionally large flowers (Nikolov and Davis 2017).
The flowers of _Rafflesia_ are known to emit a putrid odor. The scent resembles the smell of rotting flesh which attracts pollinating carrion flies (_e.g. Calliphora, Chrysomya, Hypopygiopsis, Lucilia_ , and _Sarcophaga_) (Nikolov and Davis 2017, Mursyidah et al. 2023). The nature of rotten scents of carrion flowers has long been regarded as similar to those produced by decomposing dead animals (Johnson and Jürgens 2010). However, due perhaps to the rarity and enormous size of _Rafflesia_ flowers, studies on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that comprise their odor have remained limited.
Currently, only the floral volatile constituents of _R. cantleyi_ and _R. kerri_ have been characterized. Wee et al. (2018) found that dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are the predominant floral volatiles emitted by _R. cantleyi._ These sulfur-containing compounds are known as products of microbial breakdown of sulfur-bearing amino acids (_e.g._ cysteine and methionine) commonly found in meat (Bouwmeester et al. 2019). These oligosulfides were also demonstrated to preferentially attract female carrion flies in behavioral assays (Wee et al. 2018). Other compounds such as benzenoids, monoterpenoids, fatty acid derivatives, and sesquiterpenoids were also detected in _R. cantleyi_ floral scent in trace amounts (Wee et al. 2018). However, where these compounds are produced in the flower remains unknown. In _R. kerri,_ Zain et al. (2020) detected alkanes, alkenes, cyclic siloxanes, and aromatic acid volatiles in ethanolic extracts from central disk tissues.
The process of VOC emission is developmentally regulated, with the biosynthesis of some compounds commencing once floral structures have reached specific stages of development (Manchado-Rojo et al. 2012, Muhlemann et al. 2012). As such, scent composition may vary for flowers of different stages (_i.e._ bud, pre-bloom, full-bloom, senescing) (Ren et al. 2016). For instance, in petunia flowers, it was found that volatile production begins upon flower opening and that expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in VOC biosynthesis is upregulated in post-anthesis flowers compared to buds (Shor et al. 2023). Likewise, in snapdragon flowers, emission of methyl benzoate, a compound that attracts bumblebee pollinators, was found to commence during anthesis, peak for several days, then decline afterward (Dudareva et al. 2000). The same study also found that production and activity of the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of methyl benzoate are limited only to the upper and lower lobes of the petals, indicating tissue-specificity of volatile synthesis within the flower. Whilst essential for understanding developmental regulation of VOC synthesis, studies that involve scent profiling at different stages of floral development remain challenging for _Rafflesia_. This is mainly due to the difficulty of finding populations large enough to allow volatile extractions on multiple flowers, representative of varying developmental stages. Identification of the floral structures responsible for the emission of different VOCs, which would require collection and dissection of flowers, also remains unexplored in the genus due to its rare occurrence and threatened or endangered status.
To address these knowledge gaps, we characterized the floral scent emitted by _Rafflesia consueloae_ , the smallest among all _Rafflesia_ species, with floral diameters seldom reaching 10 centimeters (Galindon et al. 2016). We used a non-destructive, _in situ_ volatile collection method to identify the VOCs emitted by different developmental stages, including the fruit. Furthermore, we report the volatile profiles of the different floral organs of full-bloom flowers. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report on the scent profiles of different reproductive stages and floral organs of _Rafflesia._ Data from this study will help elucidate specific mechanisms of _Rafflesia_ pollination and seed dispersal biology.

## Study species and study site
_Rafflesia consueloae_ Galindon, Ong & Fernando is an endophytic parasite observed to first emerge from woody adventitious roots of its _Tetrastigma_ (Vitaceae) host as flower buds. In a single host vine, various developmental stages of the flower may be found. Based on _R. consueloae_ floral stages described by Tolod et al. (2021), young buds are those that were still in the bract or early perigone phase (_i.e._ still completely covered with bracts or with a small portion of the abaxial surface of the 
## Results
A total of 13 compounds were identified in the floral scent of _R. consueloae_. These were (1) a sulfur-bearing compound: dimethyl disulfide; (2) benzenoids: toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, p-xylene, m-xylene, 1,2,3-trimethyl benzene, 2-methyl-2-butenyl benzene; (3) a monoterpenoid: D-limonene; (4) a fatty-acid derived compound: nonanal; (5) an alkane: heneicosane; and organosilicon compounds: hexamethyl cyclotrisiloxane, decamethyl cyclotrisiloxane. The majority of the compounds identified were 
## Discussion
_Rafflesia_ belongs to a subset of holoparasitic plants that completely lack an external vegetative body and reside within its host as an endophyte. With flowers being the only organs formed, these holoparasites mainly reproduce sexually, mostly relying on animals for pollination (Bellot and Renner 2013, Anggunira et al. 2019, Amorim et al. 2020, Rios-Carrasco et al. 2021). Sexual reproduction in parasitic organisms is generally considered advantageous since increased genetic diversity may result 
## Conclusions
This study provides the first account of the volatile components emitted by _Rafflesia consueloae_ flowers. While we found that some VOCs are emitted in all reproductive stages of _R. consueloae_ , certain compounds like dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) are only produced when the flower is in full bloom. Our investigation provides the first evidence of developmental regulation of volatile synthesis in _Rafflesia_ flowers. We also found that volatile synthesis varied spatially within the _R. consueloae_ flower.
