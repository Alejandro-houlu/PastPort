Often called the corpse flower, _Rafflesia arnoldi_ blooms into the single largest individual flower in the world.
When it does, it emits a vile aroma, similar to rotten meat, attracting insects, such as flies and beetles, that feed on dead flesh.
These flesh-loving creatures pollinate the flower, allowing it to spread through the rainforests of Borneo.
Due to the incredibly specific requirements of the plant, almost no botanical gardens have a _Rafflesia arnoldi_ in cultivation, including Kew.
> _Rafflesia arnoldi_ has no leaves, stems or roots, and is a parasitic plant that grows on vines in the genus _Tetrastigma._
##  Plant description 
_Rafflesia arnoldi_ lives inside _Tetrastigma_ vines as a mass of fleshy strands which absorb water and nutrients from the host. It grows out of the host plant's bark as brown, cabbage-like buds called knops which bloom over several days. The flowers have five lobes, are reddish-brown with white spots, and grow up to 1m across. They appear for a week, releasing a scent of rotting meat.

##  Plant uses 
The flower is an iconic symbol of southeast Asian rainforest, and has been depicted on several Indonesian postage stamps.
The flower buds are used in traditional medicine to help with pregnancy, and as an aphrodisiac, although there has been limited scientific investigation into their effectiveness.
##  Did you know? 
  * While it isn’t listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, numbers of _Rafflesia_ species across Indonesia are **falling due to the impact of ecotourism**.
  * To assist with pollination, _Rafflesia_ flowers also **produce heat** which
  * _Rafflesia arnoldi_ pollen, unlike many other pollens, is a **thick sticky liquid that dries on the back of flies** and can be transported several miles before pollinating another flower.
  * There is evidence to suggest that _Rafflesia arnoldi_ has **stolen DNA from its host species****through a process called 'horizontal gene transfer'**.
  * _Rafflesia arnoldi_ is often confused with another 'corpse flower', the titan arum. Although they both have large flowers and produce the smell of rotten meat, **they are completely unrelated**.
