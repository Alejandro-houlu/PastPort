_Crocodylus porosus_), crocodile species inhabiting brackish waters of wetlands and marine intertidal environments from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar east to the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu and south to Australia’s northern coast. The estuarine crocodile is the largest reptile in the world, and the species is known for its aggressive nature, as shown by numerous attacks on people and livestock each year.

estuarine crocodile, or saltwater crocodile (_Crocodylus porosus_)Estuarine, or saltwater, crocodile (_Crocodylus porosus_). This crocodile can consume any animals it captures, including humans and other estuarine crocodiles.(more)
Estuarine crocodiles are the largest and heaviest of living reptiles, growing up to 7 metres (about 23 feet) long and weighing up to 1,200 kg (nearly 2,650 pounds). Most, however, range from 2.3 to 3.3 metres (about 7.5 to 10.8 feet) in length and weigh 150 to 300 kg (330 to 660 pounds). Males tend to be about one-third larger and heavier than females. Nocturnal hunters, estuarine crocodiles can consume any animal that they can capture—including people and other estuarine crocodiles. They typically prey on everything from insects, crustaceans, small reptiles, and birds up to animals the size of a water buffalo. They often emerge from below the surface of a body of water to strike at an unsuspecting victim, pulling it into the water to devour it.

Females become sexually mature at about age 10–12, some five years earlier than males. After mating, a female crocodile can produce a clutch of 40–70 eggs, which she lays in a mound of rotting vegetation where the heat from the sun and the heat generated by decomposition combine to warm the eggs. She remains at the nest to defend the eggs from predators until, some 90 days later, the eggs hatch. The young crocodiles will remain with their mother until they leave her care some five weeks later. Estuarine crocodiles are thought to live for about 50 years in the wild.

estuarine crocodile, or saltwater crocodile (_Crocodylus porosus_)Estuarine, or saltwater, crocodile (_Crocodylus porosus_). This crocodile species competes with people for fish and has a reputation for attacking livestock near the water's edge.(more)
Because the species is adaptable and has a large stable population, estimated at some 500,000 mature animals, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) lists the estuarine crocodile as a species of least concern. Between the 1940s and 1970s, however, the crocodiles were hunted for their skins, and their population fell until officials from several countries prioritized the conservation of crocodile habitat and protected them from poachers. The greatest current threats to individual crocodiles exist in areas where their habitat overlaps with that of human beings. Estuarine crocodiles compete with people for fish and have a reputation for attacking livestock near the edges of waterways. They are known to have made numerous attacks on people. Such attacks often trigger retaliation hunts. Moreover, according to some ecologists, the conversion of wetlands and other natural areas to agricultural and other uses, combined with the effects of water pollution, removes or degrades crocodile habitat, which may result in population declines over the long term.

American alligatorThe American alligator (_Alligator mississippiensis_) is found in the southeastern United States.(more)
amphibious animals of lizard-like appearance and carnivorous habit belonging to the reptile order Crocodylia. Crocodiles have powerful jaws with many conical teeth and short legs with clawed webbed toes. They share a unique body form that allows the eyes, ears, and nostrils to be above the water surface while most of the animal is hidden below. The tail is long and massive, and the skin is thick and plated.
Crocodiles are a living link with the dinosaur-like reptiles of prehistoric times and are the nearest living relatives of the birds. A large variety of crocodilian fossils have been discovered that date back 200 million years to the Late Triassic Epoch. Fossil evidence also suggests that three major radiations occurred. Only one of the four suborders of crocodiles has survived to modern times. The order Crocodylia includes the “true crocodiles,” alligators, caimans, and gavials.

Crocodiles are the largest and the heaviest of present-day reptiles. The largest representatives, the Nile crocodile (_Crocodylus niloticus_) of Africa and the estuarine (or saltwater) crocodile (_C. porosus_) of Southeast Asia and Australia, attain lengths of up to 7 meters (about 23 feet) and weigh more than 1,200 kg (nearly 2,650 pounds). Some fossil forms (such as caiman (_Paleosuchus_) and the dwarf crocodile (_Osteolaemus tetraspis_), reach about 1.7 meters (about 6 feet) in length as adults.

All crocodiles have a relatively long snout, or muzzle, which varies considerably in shape and proportion. The scales that cover most of the body generally are arranged in a regular pattern, and thick, bony plates occur on the back. Families and genera are primarily distinguished by differences in skull anatomy. Species are identified principally by the proportions of the snout; by the bony structures on the dorsal, or upper, surface of the snout; and by the number and the arrangement of the scales.

Alligators live along the edges of permanent bodies of water. They spend most of their time in the water, hunting, but they spend the early part of the day on land, basking in the sun to increase their metabolism.(more)
Crocodiles are found mainly in the lowland, humid tropics of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The “true crocodiles” (family Crocodylidae) occur in most of Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, the East Indies, northern Australia, Mexico and Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America. In the family Alligatoridae, most caimans are confined to the tropical areas of Central and South America, though the ranges of the broad-snouted caiman (_Caiman latirostris_) and Jacaré caiman (_C. yacare_) extend into temperate areas of South America. The American alligator (_Alligator mississippiensis_) and the Chinese alligator (_A. sinensis_) also occur in temperate regions. In the family Gavialidae, the gavial (or gharial [_Gavialis gangeticus_]) is found in Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, whereas the false gharial (or false gavial [_Tomistoma schlegelii_]) inhabits freshwater habitats in Sumatra, Java, and Borneo and in Peninsular Malaysia.

Throughout their range, crocodile populations have declined as human occupation and land use change has reduced their habitat. Many crocodilian species have been greatly depleted by overhunting for their valuable skins—which provide leather for handbags, shoes, belts, and other articles. Local use of crocodiles for meat and medicines is also widespread. People living near crocodiles often dislike them because the animals can become entangled in fishnets, prey on pets and livestock, and occasionally kill people.
Since about 1970 improved national protection, habitat conservation, and international regulation of trade have allowed many populations to recover. About half of the 27 species remain widespread and numerous with little chance of extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), several species (the Chinese alligator [_A. sinensis_], the Cuban crocodile [_Crocodylus rhombifer_], the Orinoco crocodile [_C. intermedius_], the Philippine crocodile [_C. mindorensis_], the Siamese crocodile [_C. siamensis_], the slender-snouted crocodile [_Mecistops cataphractus_], and the gavial [_G. gangeticus_]) are critically endangered or (in the case of the false gharial [_T. schlegelii_]) endangered and face extinction if human pressures on their habitat are not relieved.

Sustainable harvesting, regulated trade, and education have become valuable components of crocodilian conservation. Worldwide, various programs exist to provide incentives and economic benefits to communities that conserve habitat. For example, some communities in the Philippines are paid for each egg made safe from collectors or those intent on destroying nests. Crocodilian conservation has become a model for sustainable resource use. Commercial production by captive breeding, the collection of excess eggs from the wild, and regulated hunting yield 800,000–1,000,000 legal skins each year to international markets.
