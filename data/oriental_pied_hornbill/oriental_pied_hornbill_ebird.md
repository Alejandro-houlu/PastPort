## Identification
POWERED BY MERLIN
+ 3 more audio recordings
A small black-and-white hornbill with a whitish-yellow bill and “helmet.” Primarily black, but with a white belly, facial patch, and wing and tail edges. Sexes are similar, but males have a much larger “helmet” than the female. More tolerant of human habitation than other hornbills and can sometimes be found in large city parks as well as open forests and edges. Noisy and social, often giving loud yapping calls to flockmates.
